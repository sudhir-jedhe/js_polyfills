Let's break down the code step by step to understand what happens and why the final output might not be what you expect:

```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 3];  // Define array a with elements 1, 2, and 3
const b = a.push(4);   // Push 4 to the array a, and assign the return value to b
const c = b.push(5);   // Try to call push on b and assign the return value to c
console.log(c);        // Log the value of c
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **`const a = [1, 2, 3];`**  
   This creates an array `a` with the elements `[1, 2, 3]`.

2. **`const b = a.push(4);`**  
   The `push()` method is called on the array `a`, which appends the value `4` to the end of the array. 
   
   - **What happens here**: The `push()` method returns the **new length** of the array after the element is added. In this case, the original array `[1, 2, 3]` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, so the return value of `push(4)` is `4` (the new length of the array).
   - Therefore, `b` is assigned the value `4`, which is the length of the array `a` after `4` is added.

3. **`const c = b.push(5);`**  
   Now, you're trying to call `push(5)` on `b`, but `b` is **not** an array — it's the number `4`, which is the return value from the previous `push()` call. 

   - **What happens here**: Since `b` is a number (`4`), not an array, calling `push()` on it will throw an error. Numbers don't have a `push()` method.
   
   - The code would throw a **TypeError** at this point:  
     ```
     TypeError: b.push is not a function
     ```

### Conclusion:
The code will throw a `TypeError` on the line `const c = b.push(5);` because `b` is a number (`4`), and numbers do not have the `push()` method. The correct behavior would be to use the `push()` method on the array itself, not on the result of the `push()` method.

If you intended to add `5` to the array, you should modify the code like this:

```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 3];
a.push(4);   // Add 4 to the array
a.push(5);   // Add 5 to the array
console.log(a);  // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This would log `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
