
5.   ### What are break and continue statements

     The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

     ```javascript
     for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i === 5) {
         break;
       }
       text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
     }
     ```

     The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

     ```javascript
     for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i === 5) {
         continue;
       }
       text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
     }
     ```

6.   ### What are js labels

     The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the numbers when they are same,

     ```javascript
     var i, j;

     loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
       loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
         if (i === j) {
           continue loop1;
         }
         console.log("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
       }
     }

     // Output is:
     //   "i = 1, j = 0"
     //   "i = 2, j = 0"
     //   "i = 2, j = 1"
     ```

40.  ### What are various operators supported by javascript

     An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,

     1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Includes + (Addition),– (Subtraction), \* (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), + + (Increment) and – – (Decrement)
     2. **Comparison Operators:** Includes = =(Equal),!= (Not Equal), ===(Equal with type), > (Greater than),> = (Greater than or Equal to),< (Less than),<= (Less than or Equal to)
     3. **Logical Operators:** Includes &&(Logical AND),||(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT)
     4. **Assignment Operators:** Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), – = (Subtract and Assignment Operator), \*= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
     5. **Ternary Operators:** It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
     6. **typeof Operator:** It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like `typeof variable`

41.  ### What is a rest parameter

     Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
       // ...
     }
     ```

     For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

     ```javascript
     function sum(...args) {
       let total = 0;
       for (const i of args) {
         total += i;
       }
       return total;
     }

     console.log(sum(1, 2)); //3
     console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); //6
     console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); //13
     console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); //15
     ```

     **Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

42.  ### What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument

     The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

     ```javascript
     function someFunc(a,…b,c){
     //You code goes here
     return;
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

43.  ### What are the bitwise operators available in javascript

     Below are the list of bitwise logical operators used in JavaScript

     1. Bitwise AND ( & )
     2. Bitwise OR ( | )
     3. Bitwise XOR ( ^ )
     4. Bitwise NOT ( ~ )
     5. Left Shift ( << )
     6. Sign Propagating Right Shift ( >> )
     7. Zero fill Right Shift ( >>> )

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

44.  ### What is a spread operator

     Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,

     ```javascript
     function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
       return x + y + z;
     }

     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

     console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
     ```

51.  ### How do you determine whether object is frozen or not

     Object.isFrozen() method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,

     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If all its data properties are non-writable.
        The usage is going to be as follows,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Welcome JS world",
     };
     Object.freeze(object);
     console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

52.  ### How do you determine two values same or not using object

     The Object.is() method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,

     ```javascript
     Object.is("hello", "hello"); // true
     Object.is(window, window); // true
     Object.is([], []); // false
     ```

     Two values are the same if one of the following holds:

     1. both undefined
     2. both null
     3. both true or both false
     4. both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
     5. both the same object (means both object have same reference)
     6. both numbers and
        both +0
        both -0
        both NaN
        both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

53.  ### What is the purpose of using object is method

     Some of the applications of Object's `is` method are follows,

     1. It is used for comparison of two strings.
     2. It is used for comparison of two numbers.
     3. It is used for comparing the polarity of two numbers.
     4. It is used for comparison of two objects.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

54.  ### How do you copy properties from one object to other

     You can use the Object.assign() method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the source objects. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     Object.assign(target, ...sources);
     ```

     Let's take example with one source and one target object,

     ```javascript
     const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
     const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

     const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

     console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

     console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
     ```

     As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55.  ### What are the applications of assign method

     Below are the some of main applications of Object.assign() method,

     1. It is used for cloning an object.
     2. It is used to merge objects with the same properties.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

56.  ### What is a proxy object

     The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc. The syntax would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
     ```

     Let's take an example of proxy object,

     ```javascript
     var handler = {
       get: function (obj, prop) {
         return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 100;
       },
     };

     var p = new Proxy({}, handler);
     p.a = 10;
     p.b = null;

     console.log(p.a, p.b); // 10, null
     console.log("c" in p, p.c); // false, 100
     ```

     In the above code, it uses `get` handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

57.  ### What is the purpose of seal method

     The **Object.seal()** method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. Let's see the below example to understand more about seal() method

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Welcome JS world",
     };
     Object.seal(object);
     object.property = "Welcome to object world";
     console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true
     delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
     console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

58.  ### What are the applications of seal method

     Below are the main applications of Object.seal() method,

     1. It is used for sealing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make an object immutable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

59.  ### What are the differences between freeze and seal methods

     If an object is frozen using the Object.freeze() method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the Object.seal() method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

60.  ### How do you determine if an object is sealed or not

     The Object.isSealed() method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true

     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable).
        Let's see it in the action

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Hello, Good morning",
     };

     Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object

     console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // checking whether the object is sealed or not
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

61.  ### How do you get enumerable key and value pairs

     The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of object.entries() method in an example,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       a: "Good morning",
       b: 100,
     };

     for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
       console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
       // b: 100
     }
     ```

     **Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

62.  ### What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method

     The Object.values() method's behavior is similar to Object.entries() method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       a: "Good morning",
       b: 100,
     };

     for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
       console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning'
       100;
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

63.  ### How can you get the list of keys of any object

     You can use the `Object.keys()` method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: "John",
       gender: "male",
       age: 40,
     };

     console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

64.  ### How do you create an object with prototype

     The Object.create() method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: "John",
       printInfo: function () {
         console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
       },
     };

     const admin = Object.create(user);

     admin.name = "Nick"; // Remember that "name" is a property set on "admin" but not on "user" object

     admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick
     ```

65.  ### What is a WeakSet

     WeakSet is used to store a collection of weakly(weak references) held objects. The syntax would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     new WeakSet([iterable]);
     ```

     Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,

     ```javascript
     var ws = new WeakSet();
     var user = {};
     ws.add(user);
     ws.has(user); // true
     ws.delete(user); // removes user from the set
     ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

66.  ### What are the differences between WeakSet and Set

     The main difference is that references to objects in Set are strong while references to objects in WeakSet are weak. i.e, An object in WeakSet can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
     Other differences are,

     1. Sets can store any value Whereas WeakSets can store only collections of objects
     2. WeakSet does not have size property unlike Set
     3. WeakSet does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
     4. WeakSet is not iterable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67.  ### List down the collection of methods available on WeakSet

     Below are the list of methods available on WeakSet,

     1. add(value): A new object is appended with the given value to the weakset
     2. delete(value): Deletes the value from the WeakSet collection.
     3. has(value): It returns true if the value is present in the WeakSet Collection, otherwise it returns false.

     Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,

     ```javascript
     var weakSetObject = new WeakSet();
     var firstObject = {};
     var secondObject = {};
     // add(value)
     weakSetObject.add(firstObject);
     weakSetObject.add(secondObject);
     console.log(weakSetObject.has(firstObject)); //true
     weakSetObject.delete(secondObject);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

68.  ### What is a WeakMap

     The WeakMap object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. In this case, keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values. The syntax is looking like as below,

     ```javascript
     new WeakMap([iterable]);
     ```

     Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,

     ```javascript
     var ws = new WeakMap();
     var user = {};
     ws.set(user);
     ws.has(user); // true
     ws.delete(user); // removes user from the map
     ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

69.  ### What are the differences between WeakMap and Map

     The main difference is that references to key objects in Map are strong while references to key objects in WeakMap are weak. i.e, A key object in WeakMap can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.
     Other differences are,

     1. Maps can store any key type Whereas WeakMaps can store only collections of key objects
     2. WeakMap does not have size property unlike Map
     3. WeakMap does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.
     4. WeakMap is not iterable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

70.  ### List down the collection of methods available on WeakMap

     Below are the list of methods available on WeakMap,

     1. set(key, value): Sets the value for the key in the WeakMap object. Returns the WeakMap object.
     2. delete(key): Removes any value associated to the key.
     3. has(key): Returns a Boolean asserting whether a value has been associated to the key in the WeakMap object or not.
     4. get(key): Returns the value associated to the key, or undefined if there is none.
        Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,

     ```javascript
     var weakMapObject = new WeakMap();
     var firstObject = {};
     var secondObject = {};
     // set(key, value)
     weakMapObject.set(firstObject, "John");
     weakMapObject.set(secondObject, 100);
     console.log(weakMapObject.has(firstObject)); //true
     console.log(weakMapObject.get(firstObject)); // John
     weakMapObject.delete(secondObject);
     ```

71.  ### What is the purpose of uneval

     The uneval() is an inbuilt function which is used to create a string representation of the source code of an Object. It is a top-level function and is not associated with any object. Let's see the below example to know more about it's functionality,

     ```javascript
     var a = 1;
     uneval(a); // returns a String containing 1
     uneval(function user() {}); // returns "(function user(){})"
     ```

     The `uneval()` function has been deprecated. It is recommended to use `toString()` for functions and `JSON.toStringify()` for other cases.

     ```javascript
     function user() {}
     console.log(user.toString()); // returns "(function user(){})"
     ```

72.  ### How do you encode an URL

     The encodeURI() function is used to encode complete URI which has special characters except (, / ? : @ & = + $ #) characters.

     ```javascript
     var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";
     var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
     console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

73.  ### How do you decode an URL

     The decodeURI() function is used to decode a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI().

     ```javascript
     var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";
     var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
     console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
     try {
       console.log(decodeURI(encoded)); // "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы"
     } catch (e) {
       // catches a malformed URI
       console.error(e);
     }
     ```

74.  ### How do you print the contents of web page

     The window object provided a print() method which is used to print the contents of the current window. It opens a Print dialog box which lets you choose between various printing options. Let's see the usage of print method in an example,

     ```html
     <input type="button" value="Print" onclick="window.print()" />
     ```

     **Note:** In most browsers, it will block while the print dialog is open.

75.  ### What is the difference between uneval and eval

     The `uneval` function returns the source of a given object; whereas the `eval` function does the opposite, by evaluating that source code in a different memory area. Let's see an example to clarify the difference,

     ```javascript
     var msg = uneval(function greeting() {
       return "Hello, Good morning";
     });
     var greeting = eval(msg);
     greeting(); // returns "Hello, Good morning"
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

76.  ### What is an anonymous function

     An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function (optionalParameters) {
       //do something
     }

     const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
       //do something
     };

     [1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
       //do something
     });
     ```

     Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,

     ```javascript
     var x = function (a, b) {
       return a * b;
     };
     var z = x(5, 10);
     console.log(z); // 50
     ```

77.  ### What is the precedence order between local and global variables

     A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Good morning";
     function greeting() {
       msg = "Good Evening";
       console.log(msg); // Good Evening
     }
     greeting();
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

78.  ### What are javascript accessors

     ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses the `get` keyword whereas Setters uses the `set` keyword.

     ```javascript
     var user = {
       firstName: "John",
       lastName: "Abraham",
       language: "en",
       get lang() {
         return this.language;
       },
       set lang(lang) {
         this.language = lang;
       },
     };
     console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
     user.lang = "fr";
     console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
     ```

79.  ### How do you define property on Object constructor

     The Object.defineProperty() static method is used to define a new property directly on an object, or modify an existing property on an object, and returns the object. Let's see an example to know how to define property,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};

     Object.defineProperty(newObject, "newProperty", {
       value: 100,
       writable: false,
     });

     console.log(newObject.newProperty); // 100

     newObject.newProperty = 200; // It throws an error in strict mode due to writable setting
     ```

80.  ### What is the difference between get and defineProperty

     Both have similar results until unless you use classes. If you use `get` the property will be defined on the prototype of the object whereas using `Object.defineProperty()` the property will be defined on the instance it is applied to.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

81.  ### What are the advantages of Getters and Setters

     Below are the list of benefits of Getters and Setters,

     1. They provide simpler syntax
     2. They are used for defining computed properties, or accessors in JS.
     3. Useful to provide equivalence relation between properties and methods
     4. They can provide better data quality
     5. Useful for doing things behind the scenes with the encapsulated logic.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

82.  ### Can I add getters and setters using defineProperty method

     Yes, You can use the `Object.defineProperty()` method to add Getters and Setters. For example, the below counter object uses increment, decrement, add and subtract properties,

     ```javascript
     var obj = { counter: 0 };

     // Define getters
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "increment", {
       get: function () {
         this.counter++;
       },
     });
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "decrement", {
       get: function () {
         this.counter--;
       },
     });

     // Define setters
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "add", {
       set: function (value) {
         this.counter += value;
       },
     });
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "subtract", {
       set: function (value) {
         this.counter -= value;
       },
     });

     obj.add = 10;
     obj.subtract = 5;
     console.log(obj.increment); //6
     console.log(obj.decrement); //5
     ```

83.  ### What is the purpose of switch-case

     The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In a few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     switch (expression)
     {
         case value1:
             statement1;
             break;
         case value2:
             statement2;
             break;
         .
         .
         case valueN:
             statementN;
             break;
         default:
             statementDefault;
     }
     ```

     The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

84.  ### What are the conventions to be followed for the usage of switch case

     Below are the list of conventions should be taken care,

     1. The expression can be of type either number or string.
     2. Duplicate values are not allowed for the expression.
     3. The default statement is optional. If the expression passed to switch does not match with any case value then the statement within default case will be executed.
     4. The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement sequence.
     5. The break statement is optional. But if it is omitted, the execution will continue on into the next case.

85.  ### What are primitive data types

     A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.

     1. string
     2. number
     3. boolean
     4. null
     5. undefined
     6. bigint
     7. symbol

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

86.  ### What are the different ways to access object properties

     There are 3 possible ways for accessing the property of an object.

     1. **Dot notation:** It uses dot for accessing the properties

     ```javascript
     objectName.property;
     ```

     2. **Square brackets notation:** It uses square brackets for property access

     ```javascript
     objectName["property"];
     ```

     3. **Expression notation:** It uses expression in the square brackets

     ```javascript
     objectName[expression];
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87.  ### What are the function parameter rules

     JavaScript functions follow below rules for parameters,

     1. The function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.
     2. Do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.
     3. Do not check the number of arguments received.
        i.e, The below function follows the above rules,

     ```javascript
     function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
       console.log(parameter1); // 1
     }
     functionName(1);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

88.  ### What is an error object

     An error object is a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs. It has two properties: name and message. For example, the below function logs error details,

     ```javascript
     try {
       greeting("Welcome");
     } catch (err) {
       console.log(err.name + "<br>" + err.message);
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

89.  ### When you get a syntax error

     A SyntaxError is thrown if you try to evaluate code with a syntax error. For example, the below missing quote for the function parameter throws a syntax error

     ```javascript
     try {
       eval("greeting('welcome)"); // Missing ' will produce an error
     } catch (err) {
       console.log(err.name);
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

90.  ### What are the different error names from error object

     There are 6 different types of error names returned from error object,
     | Error Name | Description |
     |---- | ---------
     | EvalError | An error has occurred in the eval() function |
     | RangeError | An error has occurred with a number "out of range" |
     | ReferenceError | An error due to an illegal reference|
     | SyntaxError | An error due to a syntax error|
     | TypeError | An error due to a type error |
     | URIError | An error due to encodeURI() |

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

91.  ### What are the various statements in error handling

     Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,

     1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
     2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
     3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
     4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

92.  ### What are the two types of loops in javascript

     1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For Loop and While Loop comes under this category.
     2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. i.e, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under this category.

93.  ### What is nodejs

     Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. It is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

94.  ### What is an Intl object

     The Intl object is the namespace for the ECMAScript Internationalization API, which provides language sensitive string comparison, number formatting, and date and time formatting. It provides access to several constructors and language sensitive functions.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

95.  ### How do you perform language specific date and time formatting

     You can use the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` object which is a constructor for objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting. Let's see this behavior with an example,

     ```javascript
     var date = new Date(Date.UTC(2019, 07, 07, 3, 0, 0));
     console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-GB").format(date)); // 07/08/2019
     console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-AU").format(date)); // 07/08/2019
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

96.  ### What is an Iterator

     An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a `next()` method which returns an object with two properties: `value` (the next value in the sequence) and `done` (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

97.  ### How does synchronous iteration works

     Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,

     **Iterable:** It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator.
     **Iterator:** It is an object returned by invoking `[Symbol.iterator]()` on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via `next()` method one by one.
     **IteratorResult:** It is an object returned by `next()` method. The object contains two properties; the `value` property contains an iterated element and the `done` property determines whether the element is the last element or not.

     Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below,

     ```javascript
     const iterable = ["one", "two", "three"];
     const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'one', done: false }
     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'two', done: false }
     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'three', done: false }
     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'undefined, done: true }
     ```

98.  ### What is an event loop

     The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of the event queue.

     **Note:** The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

99.  ### What is call stack

     Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,

     1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.
     2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.

     Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format

     ```javascript
     function hungry() {
       eatFruits();
     }
     function eatFruits() {
       return "I'm eating fruits";
     }

     // Invoke the `hungry` function
     hungry();
     ```

     The above code processed in a call stack as below,

     3. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
     4. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.
     5. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.
     6. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.

100. ### What is an event queue

     The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.

     Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of the promise is moved into the microtask queue).

     The event loop constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event loop moves the callback into the call stack. But if there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue.

101. ### What is a decorator

     A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on the target object. Let's define admin decorator for user class at design time,

     ```javascript
     function admin(isAdmin) {
        return function(target) {
            target.isAdmin = isAdmin;
        }
     }

     @admin(true)
     class User() {
     }
     console.log(User.isAdmin); //true

      @admin(false)
      class User() {
      }
      console.log(User.isAdmin); //false
     ```

102. ### What are the properties of Intl object

     Below are the list of properties available on Intl object,

     1. **Collator:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive string comparison.
     2. **DateTimeFormat:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting.
     3. **ListFormat:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive list formatting.
     4. **NumberFormat:** Objects that enable language-sensitive number formatting.
     5. **PluralRules:** Objects that enable plural-sensitive formatting and language-specific rules for plurals.
     6. **RelativeTimeFormat:** Objects that enable language-sensitive relative time formatting.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

103. ### What is an Unary operator

     The unary(+) operator is used to convert a variable to a number.If the variable cannot be converted, it will still become a number but with the value NaN. Let's see this behavior in an action.

     ```javascript
     var x = "100";
     var y = +x;
     console.log(typeof x, typeof y); // string, number

     var a = "Hello";
     var b = +a;
     console.log(typeof a, typeof b, b); // string, number, NaN
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

104. ### How do you sort elements in an array

     The sort() method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The example usage would be as below,

     ```javascript
     var months = ["Aug", "Sep", "Jan", "June"];
     months.sort();
     console.log(months); //  ["Aug", "Jan", "June", "Sep"]
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

105. ### What is the purpose of compareFunction while sorting arrays

     The compareFunction is used to define the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value. Let's take an example to see the usage of compareFunction,

     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
     numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
     console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

106. ### How do you reversing an array

     You can use the reverse() method to reverse the elements in an array. This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see the usage of reverse() method in an example,

     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];
     numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);
     numbers.reverse();
     console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
     ```

107. ### How do you find min and max value in an array

     You can use `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods on array variables to find the minimum and maximum elements within an array. Let's create two functions to find the min and max value with in an array,

     ```javascript
     var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
     function findMin(arr) {
       return Math.min.apply(null, arr);
     }
     function findMax(arr) {
       return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
     }

     console.log(findMin(marks));
     console.log(findMax(marks));
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

108. ### How do you find min and max values without Math functions

     You can write functions which loop through an array comparing each value with the lowest value or highest value to find the min and max values. Let's create those functions to find min and max values,

     ```javascript
     var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];
     function findMin(arr) {
       var length = arr.length;
       var min = Infinity;
       while (length--) {
         if (arr[length] < min) {
           min = arr[length];
         }
       }
       return min;
     }

     function findMax(arr) {
       var length = arr.length;
       var max = -Infinity;
       while (length--) {
         if (arr[length] > max) {
           max = arr[length];
         }
       }
       return max;
     }

     console.log(findMin(marks));
     console.log(findMax(marks));
     ```

109. ### What is an empty statement and purpose of it

     The empty statement is a semicolon (;) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one. Since there is no action with an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,

     ```javascript
     // Initialize an array a
     for (let i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

110. ### How do you get metadata of a module

     You can use the `import.meta` object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as the module's URL. In browsers, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.

     ```javascript
     <script type="module" src="welcome-module.js"></script>;
     console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/welcome-module.js" }
     ```

111. ### What is a comma operator

     The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as below,

     ```javascript
     var x = 1;
     x = (x++, x);

     console.log(x); // 2
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

112. ### What is the advantage of a comma operator

     It is normally used to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. One of the common usages of this comma operator is to supply multiple parameters in a `for` loop. For example, the below for loop uses multiple expressions in a single location using comma operator,

     ```javascript
     for (var a = 0, b =10; a <= 10; a++, b--)
     ```

     You can also use the comma operator in a return statement where it processes before returning.

     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       var a = 1;
       return (a += 10), a; // 11
     }
     ```

113. ### What is typescript

     TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes, async/await, and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular built entirely in TypeScript and used as a primary language. You can install it globally as

     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript
     ```

     Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,

     ```typescript
     function greeting(name: string): string {
       return "Hello, " + name;
     }

     let user = "Sudheer";

     console.log(greeting(user));
     ```

     The greeting method allows only string type as argument.

114. ### What are the differences between javascript and typescript

     Below are the list of differences between javascript and typescript,

     | feature             | typescript                            | javascript                                      |

115. ### What are the advantages of typescript over javascript

     Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,

     1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.
     2. TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.
     3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.

116. ### What is an object initializer

     An object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an Object. The syntax for this expression is represented as a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). This is also known as literal notation. It is one of the ways to create an object.

     ```javascript
     var initObject = { a: "John", b: 50, c: {} };

     console.log(initObject.a); // John
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

117. ### What is a constructor method

     The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,

     ```javascript
     class Employee {
       constructor() {
         this.name = "John";
       }
     }

     var employeeObject = new Employee();

     console.log(employeeObject.name); // John
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

118. ### What happens if you write constructor more than once in a class

     The "constructor" in a class is a special method and it should be defined only once in a class. i.e, If you write a constructor method more than once in a class it will throw a `SyntaxError` error.

     ```javascript
      class Employee {
        constructor() {
          this.name = "John";
        }
        constructor() {   //  Uncaught SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor
          this.age = 30;
        }
      }

      var employeeObject = new Employee();

      console.log(employeeObject.name);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

119. ### How do you call the constructor of a parent class

     You can use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that `super()` must be called before using 'this' reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's the usage of it,

     ```javascript
     class Square extends Rectangle {
       constructor(length) {
         super(length, length);
         this.name = "Square";
       }

       get area() {
         return this.width * this.height;
       }

       set area(value) {
         this.area = value;
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

120. ### How do you get the prototype of an object

     You can use the `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` method to return the prototype of the specified object. i.e. The value of the internal `prototype` property. If there are no inherited properties then `null` value is returned.

     ```javascript
     const newPrototype = {};
     const newObject = Object.create(newPrototype);

     console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(newObject) === newPrototype); // true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

121. ### What happens If I pass string type for getPrototype method

     In ES5, it will throw a TypeError exception if the obj parameter isn't an object. Whereas in ES2015, the parameter will be coerced to an `Object`.

     ```javascript
     // ES5
     Object.getPrototypeOf("James"); // TypeError: "James" is not an object
     // ES2015
     Object.getPrototypeOf("James"); // String.prototype
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

122. ### How do you set prototype of one object to another

     You can use the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method that sets the prototype (i.e., the internal `Prototype` property) of a specified object to another object or null. For example, if you want to set prototype of a square object to rectangle object would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     Object.setPrototypeOf(Square.prototype, Rectangle.prototype);
     Object.setPrototypeOf({}, null);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

123. ### How do you check whether an object can be extendable or not

     The `Object.isExtensible()` method is used to determine if an object is extendable or not. i.e, Whether it can have new properties added to it or not.

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};
     console.log(Object.isExtensible(newObject)); //true
     ```

     **Note:** By default, all the objects are extendable. i.e, The new properties can be added or modified.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

124. ### How do you prevent an object to extend

     The `Object.preventExtensions()` method is used to prevent new properties from ever being added to an object. In other words, it prevents future extensions to the object. Let's see the usage of this property,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};
     Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // NOT extendable

     try {
       Object.defineProperty(newObject, "newProperty", {
         // Adding new property
         value: 100,
       });
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e); // TypeError: Cannot define property newProperty, object is not extensible
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

125. ### What are the different ways to make an object non-extensible

     You can mark an object non-extensible in 3 ways,

     1. Object.preventExtensions
     2. Object.seal
     3. Object.freeze

     ```javascript
     var newObject = {};

     Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // Prevent objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(newObject); // false

     var sealedObject = Object.seal({}); // Sealed objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(sealedObject); // false

     var frozenObject = Object.freeze({}); // Frozen objects are non-extensible
     Object.isExtensible(frozenObject); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

126. ### How do you define multiple properties on an object

     The `Object.defineProperties()` method is used to define new or modify existing properties directly on an object and returning the object. Let's define multiple properties on an empty object,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};

     Object.defineProperties(newObject, {
       newProperty1: {
         value: "John",
         writable: true,
       },
       newProperty2: {},
     });
     ```

127. ### What is MEAN in javascript

     The MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack is the most popular open-source JavaScript software tech stack available for building dynamic web apps where you can write both the server-side and client-side halves of the web project entirely in JavaScript.

128. ### What Is Obfuscation in javascript

     Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated javascript code(i.e, source or machine code) that is difficult for humans to understand. It is something similar to encryption, but a machine can understand the code and execute it.
     Let's see the below function before Obfuscation,

     ```javascript
     function greeting() {
       console.log("Hello, welcome to JS world");
     }
     ```

     And after the code Obfuscation, it would be appeared as below,

     ```javascript
     eval(
       (function (p, a, c, k, e, d) {
         e = function (c) {
           return c;
         };
         if (!"".replace(/^/, String)) {
           while (c--) {
             d[c] = k[c] || c;
           }
           k = [
             function (e) {
               return d[e];
             },
           ];
           e = function () {
             return "\\w+";
           };
           c = 1;
         }
         while (c--) {
           if (k[c]) {
             p = p.replace(new RegExp("\\b" + e(c) + "\\b", "g"), k[c]);
           }
         }
         return p;
       })(
         "2 1(){0.3('4, 7 6 5 8')}",
         9,
         9,
         "console|greeting|function|log|Hello|JS|to|welcome|world".split("|"),
         0,
         {}
       )
     );
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

129. ### Why do you need Obfuscation

     Below are the few reasons for Obfuscation,

     1. The Code size will be reduced. So data transfers between server and client will be fast.
     2. It hides the business logic from outside world and protects the code from others
     3. Reverse engineering is highly difficult
     4. The download time will be reduced

130. ### What is Minification

     Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters(empty spaces are removed) and variables will be renamed without changing it's functionality. It is also a type of obfuscation .

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

131. ### What are the advantages of minification

     Normally it is recommended to use minification for heavy traffic and intensive requirements of resources. It reduces file sizes with below benefits,

     1. Decreases loading times of a web page
     2. Saves bandwidth usages

132. ### What are the differences between Obfuscation and Encryption

     Below are the main differences between Obfuscation and Encryption,

     | Feature            | Obfuscation                                     | Encryption                                                              |
     | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | Definition         | Changing the form of any data in any other form | Changing the form of information to an unreadable format by using a key |
     | A key to decode    | It can be decoded without any key               | It is required                                                          |
     | Target data format | It will be converted to a complex form          | Converted into an unreadable format                                     |

133. ### What are the common tools used for minification

     There are many online/offline tools to minify the javascript files,

     1. Google's Closure Compiler
     2. UglifyJS2
     3. jsmin
     4. javascript-minifier.com/

134. ### How do you perform form validation using javascript

     JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if the form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted.
     Lets' perform user login in an html form,

     ```html
     <form name="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()" method="post">
       User name: <input type="text" name="uname" />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     ```

     And the validation on user login is below,

     ```javascript
     function validateForm() {
       var x = document.forms["myForm"]["uname"].value;
       if (x == "") {
         alert("The username shouldn't be empty");
         return false;
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

135. ### How do you perform form validation without javascript

     You can perform HTML form validation automatically without using javascript. The validation enabled by applying the `required` attribute to prevent form submission when the input is empty.

     ```html
     <form method="post">
       <input type="text" name="uname" required />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>
     ```

     **Note:** Automatic form validation does not work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

136. ### What are the DOM methods available for constraint validation

     The below DOM methods are available for constraint validation on an invalid input,

     1. checkValidity(): It returns true if an input element contains valid data.
     2. setCustomValidity(): It is used to set the validationMessage property of an input element.
        Let's take an user login form with DOM validations

     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       var userName = document.getElementById("uname");
       if (!userName.checkValidity()) {
         document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =
           userName.validationMessage;
       } else {
         document.getElementById("message").innerHTML =
           "Entered a valid username";
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

137. ### What are the available constraint validation DOM properties

     Below are the list of some of the constraint validation DOM properties available,

     1. validity: It provides a list of boolean properties related to the validity of an input element.
     2. validationMessage: It displays the message when the validity is false.
     3. willValidate: It indicates if an input element will be validated or not.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

138. ### What are the list of validity properties

     The validity property of an input element provides a set of properties related to the validity of data.

     1. customError: It returns true, if a custom validity message is set.
     2. patternMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value does not match its pattern attribute.
     3. rangeOverflow: It returns true, if an element's value is greater than its max attribute.
     4. rangeUnderflow: It returns true, if an element's value is less than its min attribute.
     5. stepMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to step attribute.
     6. tooLong: It returns true, if an element's value exceeds its maxLength attribute.
     7. typeMismatch: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to type attribute.
     8. valueMissing: It returns true, if an element with a required attribute has no value.
     9. valid: It returns true, if an element's value is valid.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

139. ### Give an example usage of rangeOverflow property

     If an element's value is greater than its max attribute then rangeOverflow property returns true. For example, the below form submission throws an error if the value is more than 100,

     ```html
     <input id="age" type="number" max="100" />
     <button onclick="myOverflowFunction()">OK</button>
     ```

     ```javascript
     function myOverflowFunction() {
       if (document.getElementById("age").validity.rangeOverflow) {
         alert("The mentioned age is not allowed");
       }
     }
     ```

140. ### Is enums feature available in javascript

     No, javascript does not natively support enums. But there are different kinds of solutions to simulate them even though they may not provide exact equivalents. For example, you can use freeze or seal on object,

     ```javascript
     var DaysEnum = Object.freeze({"monday":1, "tuesday":2, "wednesday":3, ...})
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

141. ### What is an enum

     An enum is a type restricting variables to one value from a predefined set of constants. JavaScript has no enums but typescript provides built-in enum support.

     ```javascript
     enum Color {
      RED, GREEN, BLUE
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

142. ### How do you list all properties of an object

     You can use the `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method which returns an array of all properties found directly in a given object. Let's the usage of it in an example,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {
       a: 1,
       b: 2,
       c: 3,
     };

     console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(newObject));
     ["a", "b", "c"];
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

143. ### How do you get property descriptors of an object

     You can use the `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors()` method which returns all own property descriptors of a given object. The example usage of this method is below,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {
       a: 1,
       b: 2,
       c: 3,
     };
     const descriptorsObject = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(newObject);
     console.log(descriptorsObject.a.writable); //true
     console.log(descriptorsObject.a.configurable); //true
     console.log(descriptorsObject.a.enumerable); //true
     console.log(descriptorsObject.a.value); // 1
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

144. ### What are the attributes provided by a property descriptor

     A property descriptor is a record which has the following attributes

     1. value: The value associated with the property
     2. writable: Determines whether the value associated with the property can be changed or not
     3. configurable: Returns true if the type of this property descriptor can be changed and if the property can be deleted from the corresponding object.
     4. enumerable: Determines whether the property appears during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object or not.
     5. set: A function which serves as a setter for the property
     6. get: A function which serves as a getter for the property

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

145. ### How do you extend classes

     The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations/expressions to create a class which is a child of another class. It can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     class ChildClass extends ParentClass { ... }
     ```

     Let's take an example of Square subclass from Polygon parent class,

     ```javascript
     class Square extends Rectangle {
       constructor(length) {
         super(length, length);
         this.name = "Square";
       }

       get area() {
         return this.width * this.height;
       }

       set area(value) {
         this.area = value;
       }
     }
     ```

146. ### How do I modify the url without reloading the page

     The `window.location.href` property will be helpful to modify the url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()` methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,

     ```javascript
     window.history.pushState("page2", "Title", "/page2.html");
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

147. ### How do you check whether an array includes a particular value or not

     The `Array#includes()` method is used to determine whether an array includes a particular value among its entries by returning either true or false. Let's see an example to find an element(numeric and string) within an array.

     ```javascript
     var numericArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
     console.log(numericArray.includes(3)); // true

     var stringArray = ["green", "yellow", "blue"];
     console.log(stringArray.includes("blue")); //true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

148. ### How do you compare scalar arrays

     You can use length and every method of arrays to compare two scalar(compared directly using ===) arrays. The combination of these expressions can give the expected result,

     ```javascript
     const arrayFirst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     const arraySecond = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(
       arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&
         arrayFirst.every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])
     ); // true
     ```

     If you would like to compare arrays irrespective of order then you should sort them before,

     ```javascript
     const arrayFirst = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5];
     const arraySecond = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(
       arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&
         arrayFirst.sort().every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])
     ); //true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

149. ### How to get the value from get parameters

     The `new URL()` object accepts the url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters. Remember that you may need to use polyfill or `window.location` to access the URL in older browsers(including IE).

     ```javascript
     let urlString = "http://www.some-domain.com/about.html?x=1&y=2&z=3"; //window.location.href
     let url = new URL(urlString);
     let parameterZ = url.searchParams.get("z");
     console.log(parameterZ); // 3
     ```

150. ### How do you print numbers with commas as thousand separators

     You can use the `Number.prototype.toLocaleString()` method which returns a string with a language-sensitive representation such as thousand separator,currency etc of this number.

     ```javascript
     function convertToThousandFormat(x) {
       return x.toLocaleString(); // 12,345.679
     }

     console.log(convertToThousandFormat(12345.6789));
     ```

151. ### What is the difference between java and javascript

     Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,
     | Feature | Java | JavaScript |
     |---- | ---- | -----
     | Typed | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language |
     | Paradigm | Object oriented programming | Prototype based programming |
     | Scoping | Block scoped | Function-scoped |
     | Concurrency | Thread based | event based |
     | Memory | Uses more memory | Uses less memory. Hence it will be used for web pages |

152. ### Does JavaScript supports namespace

     JavaScript doesn’t support namespace by default. So if you create any element(function, method, object, variable) then it becomes global and pollutes the global namespace. Let's take an example of defining two functions without any namespace,

     ```javascript
     function func1() {
       console.log("This is a first definition");
     }
     function func1() {
       console.log("This is a second definition");
     }
     func1(); // This is a second definition
     ```

     It always calls the second function definition. In this case, namespace will solve the name collision problem.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

153. ### How do you declare namespace

     Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects , IIFE to create namespaces.

     1. **Using Object Literal Notation:** Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation

     ```javascript
     var namespaceOne = {
        function func1() {
            console.log("This is a first definition");
        }
     }
     var namespaceTwo = {
          function func1() {
              console.log("This is a second definition");
          }
      }
     namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition
     namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition
     ```

     2. **Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression):** The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.

     ```javascript
     (function () {
       function fun1() {
         console.log("This is a first definition");
       }
       fun1();
     })();

     (function () {
       function fun1() {
         console.log("This is a second definition");
       }
       fun1();
     })();
     ```

     3. **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.

     ```javascript
     {
       let myFunction = function fun1() {
         console.log("This is a first definition");
       };
       myFunction();
     }
     //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.

     {
       let myFunction = function fun1() {
         console.log("This is a second definition");
       };
       myFunction();
     }
     //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.
     ```

154. ### How do you invoke javascript code in an iframe from parent page

     Initially iFrame needs to be accessed using either `document.getElementBy` or `window.frames`. After that `contentWindow` property of iFrame gives the access for targetFunction

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("targetFrame").contentWindow.targetFunction();
     window.frames[0].frameElement.contentWindow.targetFunction(); // Accessing iframe this way may not work in latest versions chrome and firefox
     ```

155. ### How do get the timezone offset from date

     You can use the `getTimezoneOffset` method of the date object. This method returns the time zone difference, in minutes, from current locale (host system settings) to UTC

     ```javascript
     var offset = new Date().getTimezoneOffset();
     console.log(offset); // -480
     ```

156. ### How do you load CSS and JS files dynamically

     You can create both link and script elements in the DOM and append them as child to head tag. Let's create a function to add script and style resources as below,

     ```javascript
     function loadAssets(filename, filetype) {
       if (filetype == "css") {
         // External CSS file
         var fileReference = document.createElement("link");
         fileReference.setAttribute("rel", "stylesheet");
         fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/css");
         fileReference.setAttribute("href", filename);
       } else if (filetype == "js") {
         // External JavaScript file
         var fileReference = document.createElement("script");
         fileReference.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
         fileReference.setAttribute("src", filename);
       }
       if (typeof fileReference != "undefined")
         document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(fileReference);
     }
     ```

157. ### What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM

     If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,

     1. document.getElementById(id): It finds an element by Id
     2. document.getElementsByTagName(name): It finds an element by tag name
     3. document.getElementsByClassName(name): It finds an element by class name

158. ### What is jQuery

     jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,

     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function () {
       // It selects the document and apply the function on page load
       alert("Welcome to jQuery world");
     });
     ```

     **Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.

159. ### What is V8 JavaScript engine

     V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
     **Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

160. ### Why do we call javascript as dynamic language

     JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.

     ```javascript
     let age = 50; // age is a number now
     age = "old"; // age is a string now
     age = true; // age is a boolean
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

161. ### What is a void operator

     The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined(i.e, without returning value). The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     void expression;
     void expression;
     ```

     Let's display a message without any redirection or reload

     ```javascript
     <a href="javascript:void(alert('Welcome to JS world'))">
       Click here to see a message
     </a>
     ```

     **Note:** This operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive value, using "void(0)".

162. ### How to set the cursor to wait

     The cursor can be set to wait in JavaScript by using the property "cursor". Let's perform this behavior on page load using the below function.

     ```javascript
     function myFunction() {
       window.document.body.style.cursor = "wait";
     }
     ```

     and this function invoked on page load

     ```html
     <body onload="myFunction()"></body>
     ```

163. ### How do you create an infinite loop

     You can create infinite loops using for and while loops without using any expressions. The for loop construct or syntax is better approach in terms of ESLint and code optimizer tools,

     ```javascript
     for (;;) {}
     while (true) {}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

164. ### Why do you need to avoid with statement

     JavaScript's with statement was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring accesses to objects. So it can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times.

     ```javascript
     a.b.c.greeting = "welcome";
     a.b.c.age = 32;
     ```

     Using `with` it turns this into:

     ```javascript
     with (a.b.c) {
       greeting = "welcome";
       age = 32;
     }
     ```

     But this `with` statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether an argument will refer to a real variable or to a property inside the with argument.

165. ### What is the output of below for loops

     ```javascript
     for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
       // global scope
       setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
     }

     for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
       // block scope
       setTimeout(() => console.log(i));
     }
     ```

     The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3

     **Explanation:** Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time `setTimeout` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the first loop is `4 4 4 4`.

     Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is `0 1 2 3`.

166. ### List down some of the features of ES6

     Below are the list of some new features of ES6,

     1. Support for constants or immutable variables
     2. Block-scope support for variables, constants and functions
     3. Arrow functions
     4. Default parameters
     5. Rest and Spread Parameters
     6. Template Literals
     7. Multi-line Strings
     8. Destructuring Assignment
     9. Enhanced Object Literals
     10. Promises
     11. Classes
     12. Modules

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

167. ### What is ES6

     ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

168. ### Can I redeclare let and const variables

     No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error

     ```bash
     Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared
     ```

     **Explanation:** The variable declaration with `var` keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.

     ```javascript
     var name = "John";
     function myFunc() {
       var name = "Nick";
       var name = "Abraham"; // Re-assigned in the same function block
       alert(name); // Abraham
     }
     myFunc();
     alert(name); // John
     ```

     The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,

     ```javascript
     let name = "John";
     function myFunc() {
       let name = "Nick";
       let name = "Abraham"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
       alert(name);
     }

     myFunc();
     alert(name);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

169. ### Is const variable makes the value immutable

     No, the const variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)

     ```javascript
     const userList = [];
     userList.push("John"); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign
     console.log(userList); // ['John']
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

170. ### What are default parameters

     In ES5, we need to depend on logical OR operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,

     ```javascript
     //ES5
     var calculateArea = function (height, width) {
       height = height || 50;
       width = width || 60;

       return width * height;
     };
     console.log(calculateArea()); //300
     ```

     The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,

     ```javascript
     //ES6
     var calculateArea = function (height = 50, width = 60) {
       return width * height;
     };

     console.log(calculateArea()); //300
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

171. ### What are template literals

     Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes.
     In ES6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;
     ```

     In ES5, you need break string like below,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`
     ```

     **Note:** You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

172. ### How do you write multi-line strings in template literals

     In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get multi-line strings.

     ```javascript
     console.log("This is string sentence 1\n" + "This is string sentence 2");
     ```

     Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,

     ```javascript
     console.log(`This is string sentence
     'This is string sentence 2`);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

173. ### What are nesting templates

     The nesting template is a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,

     ```javascript
     const iconStyles = `icon ${
       isMobilePlatform()
         ? ""
         : `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? "submit" : "disabled"}`
     }`;
     ```

     You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature is more compact and readable.

     ```javascript
     //Without nesting templates
     const iconStyles = `icon ${
       isMobilePlatform()
         ? ""
         : user.isAuthorized
         ? "icon-submit"
         : "icon-disabled"
     }`;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

174. ### What are tagged templates

     Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,

     ```javascript
     var user1 = "John";
     var skill1 = "JavaScript";
     var experience1 = 15;

     var user2 = "Kane";
     var skill2 = "JavaScript";
     var experience2 = 5;

     function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {
       var str0 = strings[0]; // "Mr/Ms. "
       var str1 = strings[1]; // " is a/an "
       var str2 = strings[2]; // "in"

       var expertiseStr;
       if (experienceExp > 10) {
         expertiseStr = "expert developer";
       } else if (skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {
         expertiseStr = "senior developer";
       } else {
         expertiseStr = "junior developer";
       }

       return `${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp}`;
     }

     var output1 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user1} is a/an ${experience1} in ${skill1}`;
     var output2 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user2} is a/an ${experience2} in ${skill2}`;

     console.log(output1); // Mr/Ms. John is a/an expert developer in JavaScript
     console.log(output2); // Mr/Ms. Kane is a/an junior developer in JavaScript
     ```

175. ### What are raw strings

     ES6 provides a raw strings feature using the `String.raw()` method which is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,

     ```javascript
     var calculationString = String.raw`The sum of numbers is \n${
       1 + 2 + 3 + 4
     }!`;
     console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is \n10!
     ```

     If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines

     ```javascript
     var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4}!`;
     console.log(calculationString);
     // The sum of numbers is
     // 10!
     ```

     Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag function

     ```javascript
     function tag(strings) {
       console.log(strings.raw[0]);
     }
     ```

176. ### What is destructuring assignment

     The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.
     Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment

     ```javascript
     var [one, two, three] = ["JAN", "FEB", "MARCH"];

     console.log(one); // "JAN"
     console.log(two); // "FEB"
     console.log(three); // "MARCH"
     ```

     and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,

     ```javascript
     var { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 32 };

     console.log(name); // John
     console.log(age); // 32
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

177. ### What are default values in destructuring assignment

     A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object use cases,

     **Arrays destructuring:**

     ```javascript
     var x, y, z;

     [x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];
     console.log(x); // 10
     console.log(y); // 4
     console.log(z); // 6
     ```

     **Objects destructuring:**

     ```javascript
     var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };

     console.log(x); // 10
     console.log(y); // 4
     console.log(z); // 6
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

178. ### How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment

     If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,

     ```javascript
     var x = 10,
       y = 20;

     [x, y] = [y, x];
     console.log(x); // 20
     console.log(y); // 10
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

179. ### What are enhanced object literals

     Object literals make it easy to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. For example, it provides shorter syntax for common object property definition as below.

     ```javascript
     //ES6
     var x = 10,
       y = 20;
     obj = { x, y };
     console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
     //ES5
     var x = 10,
       y = 20;
     obj = { x: x, y: y };
     console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}
     ```

180. ### What are dynamic imports

     The dynamic imports using `import()` function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this feature is in [stage4 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience.
     The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,

     ```javascript
     import("./Module").then((Module) => Module.method());
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

181. ### What are the use cases for dynamic imports

     Below are some of the use cases of using dynamic imports over static imports,

     1. Import a module on-demand or conditionally. For example, if you want to load a polyfill on legacy browser

     ```javascript
     if (isLegacyBrowser()) {
         import(···)
         .then(···);
     }
     ```

     2. Compute the module specifier at runtime. For example, you can use it for internationalization.

     ```javascript
     import(`messages_${getLocale()}.js`).then(···);
     ```

     3. Import a module from within a regular script instead a module.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

182. ### What are typed arrays

     Typed arrays are array-like objects from ECMAScript 6 API for handling binary data. JavaScript provides 8 Typed array types,

     1. Int8Array: An array of 8-bit signed integers
     2. Int16Array: An array of 16-bit signed integers
     3. Int32Array: An array of 32-bit signed integers
     4. Uint8Array: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers
     5. Uint16Array: An array of 16-bit unsigned integers
     6. Uint32Array: An array of 32-bit unsigned integers
     7. Float32Array: An array of 32-bit floating point numbers
     8. Float64Array: An array of 64-bit floating point numbers

     For example, you can create an array of 8-bit signed integers as below

     ```javascript
     const a = new Int8Array();
     // You can pre-allocate n bytes
     const bytes = 1024;
     const a = new Int8Array(bytes);
     ```

183. ### What are the advantages of module loaders

     The module loaders provides the below features,

     1. Dynamic loading
     2. State isolation
     3. Global namespace isolation
     4. Compilation hooks
     5. Nested virtualization

184. ### What is collation

     Collation is used for sorting a set of strings and searching within a set of strings. It is parameterized by locale and aware of Unicode. Let's take comparison and sorting features,

     1. **Comparison:**

     ```javascript
     var list = ["ä", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
     var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
     var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
     console.log(l10nDE.compare("ä", "z") === -1); // true
     console.log(l10nSV.compare("ä", "z") === +1); // true
     ```

     2. **Sorting:**

     ```javascript
     var list = ["ä", "a", "z"]; // In German,  "ä" sorts with "a" Whereas in Swedish, "ä" sorts after "z"
     var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator("de");
     var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator("sv");
     console.log(list.sort(l10nDE.compare)); // [ "a", "ä", "z" ]
     console.log(list.sort(l10nSV.compare)); // [ "a", "z", "ä" ]
     ```

185. ### What is for...of statement

     The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,

     ```javascript
     let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

     for (let value of arrayIterable) {
       value++;
       console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51
     }
     ```

186. ### What is the output of below spread operator array

     ```javascript
     [..."John Resig"];
     ```

     The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', '', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g']
     **Explanation:** The string is an iterable type and the spread operator within an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

187. ### Is PostMessage secure

     Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

188. ### What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard

     The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard “\*” as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

     ```javascript
     targetWindow.postMessage(message, "*");
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

189. ### How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers

     Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker’s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender’s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the “message.origin” attribute. For examples, let's check the sender's origin [http://www.some-sender.com](http://www.some-sender.com) on receiver side [www.some-receiver.com](www.some-receiver.com),

     ```javascript
     //Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/
     window.addEventListener("message", function(message){
         if(/^http://www\.some-sender\.com$/.test(message.origin)){
              console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);
        }
     });
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

190. ### Can I avoid using postMessages completely

     You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

191. ### Is postMessages synchronous

     The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

192. ### What paradigm is Javascript

     JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming, Object-Oriented Programming and functional programming. JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming with prototypical inheritance.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

193. ### What is the difference between internal and external javascript

     **Internal JavaScript:** It is the source code within the script tag.
     **External JavaScript:** The source code is stored in an external file(stored with .js extension) and referred with in the tag.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

194. ### Is JavaScript faster than server side script

     Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side scripts. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web server’s help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

195. ### How do you get the status of a checkbox

     You can apply the `checked` property on the selected checkbox in the DOM. If the value is `true` it means the checkbox is checked, otherwise it is unchecked. For example, the below HTML checkbox element can be access using javascript as below:

     ```html
     <input type="checkbox" id="checkboxname" value="Agree" /> Agree the
     conditions<br />
     ```

     ```javascript
     console.log(document.getElementById(‘checkboxname’).checked); // true or false
     ```

196. ### What is the purpose of double tilde operator

     The double tilde operator(~~) is known as double NOT bitwise operator. This operator is a slightly quicker substitute for Math.floor().

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

197. ### How do you convert character to ASCII code

     You can use the `String.prototype.charCodeAt()` method to convert string characters to ASCII numbers. For example, let's find ASCII code for the first letter of 'ABC' string,

     ```javascript
     "ABC".charCodeAt(0); // returns 65
     ```

     Whereas `String.fromCharCode()` method converts numbers to equal ASCII characters.

     ```javascript
     String.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67); // returns 'ABC'
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

198. ### What is ArrayBuffer

     An ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. You can create it as below,

     ```javascript
     let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16
     alert(buffer.byteLength); // 16
     ```

     To manipulate an ArrayBuffer, we need to use a “view” object.

     ```javascript
     //Create a DataView referring to the buffer
     let view = new DataView(buffer);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

199. ### What is the output of below string expression

     ```javascript
     console.log("Welcome to JS world"[0]);
     ```

     The output of the above expression is "W".
     **Explanation:** The bracket notation with specific index on a string returns the character at a specific location. Hence, it returns the character "W" of the string. Since this is not supported in IE7 and below versions, you may need to use the .charAt() method to get the desired result.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

200. ### What is the purpose of Error object

     The Error constructor creates an error object and the instances of error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. The syntax of error object would be as below,

     ```javascript
     new Error([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
     ```

     You can throw user defined exceptions or errors using Error object in try...catch block as below,

     ```javascript
     try {
       if (withdraw > balance)
         throw new Error("Oops! You don't have enough balance");
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e.name + ": " + e.message);
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

201. ### What is the purpose of EvalError object

     The EvalError object indicates an error regarding the global `eval()` function. Even though this exception is not thrown by JavaScript anymore, the EvalError object remains for compatibility. The syntax of this expression would be as below,

     ```javascript
     new EvalError([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])
     ```

     You can throw EvalError with in try...catch block as below,

     ```javascript
     try {
       throw new EvalError('Eval function error', 'someFile.js', 100);
     } catch (e) {
       console.log(e.message, e.name, e.fileName);              // "Eval function error", "EvalError", "someFile.js"
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

202. ### What are the list of cases error thrown from non-strict mode to strict mode

     When you apply 'use strict'; syntax, some of the below cases will throw a SyntaxError before executing the script

     1. When you use Octal syntax

     ```javascript
     var n = 022;
     ```

     2. Using `with` statement
     3. When you use delete operator on a variable name
     4. Using eval or arguments as variable or function argument name
     5. When you use newly reserved keywords
     6. When you declare a function in a block

     ```javascript
     if (someCondition) {
       function f() {}
     }
     ```

     Hence, the errors from above cases are helpful to avoid errors in development/production environments.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

203. ### Do all objects have prototypes

     No. All objects have prototypes except for the base object which is created by the user, or an object that is created using the new keyword.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

204. ### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument

     Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument represents the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's explain this with a simple function

     ```javascript
     function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
       console.log(arguments[0]); // "argument1"
       console.log(arguments[1]); // "argument2"
       console.log(arguments[2]); // "argument3"
     }
     myFunction("argument1", "argument2", "argument3");
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

205. ### What is the purpose of some method in arrays

     The some() method is used to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. The method returns a boolean value. Let's take an example to test for any odd elements,

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

     var odd = (element) => element % 2 !== 0;

     console.log(array.some(odd)); // true (the odd element exists)
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

206. ### How do you combine two or more arrays

     The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)
     ```

     Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,

     ```javascript
     var veggies = ["Tomato", "Carrot", "Cabbage"];
     var fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pears"];
     var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);
     console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

207. ### What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy

     There are two ways to copy an object,

     **Shallow Copy:**
     Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.

     **Example**

     ```javascript
     var empDetails = {
       name: "John",
       age: 25,
       expertise: "Software Developer",
     };
     ```

     to create a duplicate

     ```javascript
     var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!
     ```

     if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:

     ```javascript
     empDetailsShallowCopy.name = "Johnson";
     ```

     The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.

     **Deep copy:**
     A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.

     **Example**

     ```javascript
     var empDetails = {
       name: "John",
       age: 25,
       expertise: "Software Developer",
     };
     ```

     Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable

     ```javascript
     var empDetailsDeepCopy = {
       name: empDetails.name,
       age: empDetails.age,
       expertise: empDetails.expertise,
     };
     ```

     Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

208. ### How do you create specific number of copies of a string

     The `repeat()` method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification.
     Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,

     ```javascript
     "Hello".repeat(4); // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
     ```

209. ### How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression

     The `matchAll()` method can be used to return an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression. For example, the below example returns an array of matching string results against a regular expression,

     ```javascript
     let regexp = /Hello(\d?))/g;
     let greeting = "Hello1Hello2Hello3";

     let greetingList = [...greeting.matchAll(regexp)];

     console.log(greetingList[0]); //Hello1
     console.log(greetingList[1]); //Hello2
     console.log(greetingList[2]); //Hello3
     ```

210. ### How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending

     The `trim` method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use `trimStart/trimLeft` and `trimEnd/trimRight` methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,

     ```javascript
     var greeting = "   Hello, Goodmorning!   ";

     console.log(greeting); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!   "
     console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "
     console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // "Hello, Goodmorning!   "

     console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
     console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // "   Hello, Goodmorning!"
     ```

211. ### What is the output of below console statement with unary operator

     Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(+"Hello");
     ```

     The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

212. ### Does javascript uses mixins

     Mixin is a generic object-oriented programming term - is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it. In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. ie. There can be only one `[[prototype]]` for an object.

     But sometimes we require to extend more than one, to overcome this we can use Mixin which helps to copy methods to the prototype of another class.

     Say for instance, we've two classes `User` and `CleanRoom`. Suppose we need to add `CleanRoom` functionality to `User`, so that user can clean the room at demand. Here's where concept called mixins comes into picture.

     ```javascript
     // mixin
     let cleanRoomMixin = {
       cleanRoom() {
         alert(`Hello ${this.name}, your room is clean now`);
       },
       sayBye() {
         alert(`Bye ${this.name}`);
       },
     };

     // usage:
     class User {
       constructor(name) {
         this.name = name;
       }
     }

     // copy the methods
     Object.assign(User.prototype, cleanRoomMixin);

     // now User can clean the room
     new User("Dude").cleanRoom(); // Hello Dude, your room is clean now!
     ```

213. ### What is a thunk function

     A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn’t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,

     ```javascript
     const add = (x, y) => x + y;

     const thunk = () => add(2, 3);

     thunk(); // 5
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

214. ### What are asynchronous thunks

     The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,

     ```javascript
     function fetchData(fn) {
       fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
         .then((response) => response.json())
         .then((json) => fn(json));
     }

     const asyncThunk = function () {
       return fetchData(function getData(data) {
         console.log(data);
       });
     };

     asyncThunk();
     ```

     The `getData` function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.

215. ### What is the output of below function calls

     **Code snippet:**

     ```javascript
     const circle = {
       radius: 20,
       diameter() {
         return this.radius * 2;
       },
       perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
     };
     ```

     ```javascript
     console.log(circle.diameter());
     console.log(circle.perimeter());
     ```

     **Output:**

     The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The `this` keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.

216. ### How to remove all line breaks from a string

     The easiest approach is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case, we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.

     ```javascript
     function remove_linebreaks( var message ) {
         return message.replace( /[\r\n]+/gm, "" );
     }
     ```

     In the above expression, g and m are for global and multiline flags.

217. ### What is the difference between reflow and repaint

     A _repaint_ occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A _reflow_ involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.

218. ### What happens with negating an array

     Negating an array with `!` character will coerce the array into a boolean. Since Arrays are considered to be truthy So negating it will return `false`.

     ```javascript
     console.log(![]); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

219. ### What happens if we add two arrays

     If you add two arrays together, it will convert them both to strings and concatenate them. For example, the result of adding arrays would be as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(["a"] + ["b"]); // "ab"
     console.log([] + []); // ""
     console.log(![] + []); // "false", because ![] returns false.
     ```

220. ### What is the output of prepend additive operator on falsy values

     If you prepend the additive(+) operator on falsy values(null, undefined, NaN, false, ""), the falsy value converts to a number value zero. Let's display them on browser console as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(+null); // 0
     console.log(+undefined); // NaN
     console.log(+false); // 0
     console.log(+NaN); // NaN
     console.log(+""); // 0
     ```

221. ### How do you create self string using special characters

     The self string can be formed with the combination of `[]()!+` characters. You need to remember the below conventions to achieve this pattern.

     1. Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false
     2. As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === ""
     3. Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1

     By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions

     ```javascript
     (![] + [] === "false" + !+[]) === 1;
     ```

     Now the character pattern would be created as below,

     ```javascript
           s               e               l               f
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +
     (![] + [])[+[]]
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     (![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+[]]
     ```

222. ### How do you remove falsy values from an array

     You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and "") from the array.

     ```javascript
     const myArray = [false, null, 1, 5, undefined];
     myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);
     ```

223. ### How do you get unique values of an array

     You can get unique values of an array with the combination of `Set` and rest expression/spread(...) syntax.

     ```javascript
     console.log([...new Set([1, 2, 4, 4, 3])]); // [1, 2, 4, 3]
     ```

224. ### What is destructuring aliases

     Sometimes you would like to have a destructured variable with a different name than the property name. In that case, you'll use a `: newName` to specify a name for the variable. This process is called destructuring aliases.

     ```javascript
     const obj = { x: 1 };
     // Grabs obj.x as as { otherName }
     const { x: otherName } = obj;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

225. ### How do you map the array values without using map method

     You can map the array values without using the `map` method by just using the `from` method of Array. Let's map city names from Countries array,

     ```javascript
     const countries = [
       { name: "India", capital: "Delhi" },
       { name: "US", capital: "Washington" },
       { name: "Russia", capital: "Moscow" },
       { name: "Singapore", capital: "Singapore" },
       { name: "China", capital: "Beijing" },
       { name: "France", capital: "Paris" },
     ];

     const cityNames = Array.from(countries, ({ capital }) => capital);
     console.log(cityNames); // ['Delhi, 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'Singapore', 'Beijing', 'Paris']
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

226. ### How do you empty an array

     You can empty an array quickly by setting the array length to zero.

     ```javascript
     let cities = ["Singapore", "Delhi", "London"];
     cities.length = 0; // cities becomes []
     ```

227. ### How do you rounding numbers to certain decimals

     You can round numbers to a certain number of decimals using `toFixed` method from native javascript.

     ```javascript
     let pie = 3.141592653;
     pie = pie.toFixed(3); // 3.142
     ```

228. ### What is the easiest way to convert an array to an object

     You can convert an array to an object with the same data using spread(...) operator.

     ```javascript
     var fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "watermelon"];
     var fruitsObject = { ...fruits };
     console.log(fruitsObject); // {0: "banana", 1: "apple", 2: "orange", 3: "watermelon"}
     ```

229. ### How do you create an array with some data

     You can create an array with some data or an array with the same values using `fill` method.

     ```javascript
     var newArray = new Array(5).fill("0");
     console.log(newArray); // ["0", "0", "0", "0", "0"]
     ```

230. ### What are the placeholders from console object

     Below are the list of placeholders available from console object,

     1. %o — It takes an object,
     2. %s — It takes a string,
     3. %d — It is used for a decimal or integer
        These placeholders can be represented in the console.log as below

     ```javascript
     const user = { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" };
     console.log(
       "Hello %s, your details %o are available in the object form",
       "John",
       user
     ); // Hello John, your details {name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi"} are available in object
     ```

231. ### Is it possible to add CSS to console messages

     Yes, you can apply CSS styles to console messages similar to html text on the web page.

     ```javascript
     console.log(
       "%c The text has blue color, with large font and red background",
       "color: blue; font-size: x-large; background: red"
     );
     ```

     The text will be displayed as below,

234. ### How do you display data in a tabular format using console object

     The `console.table()` is used to display data in the console in a tabular format to visualize complex arrays or objects.

     ```js
     const users = [
       { name: "John", id: 1, city: "Delhi" },
       { name: "Max", id: 2, city: "London" },
       { name: "Rod", id: 3, city: "Paris" },
     ];
     console.table(users);
     ```

     The data visualized in a table format,

236. ### How do you create copy to clipboard button

     You need to select the content(using .select() method) of the input element and execute the copy command with execCommand (i.e, execCommand('copy')). You can also execute other system commands like cut and paste.

     ```javascript
     document.querySelector("#copy-button").onclick = function () {
       // Select the content
       document.querySelector("#copy-input").select();
       // Copy to the clipboard
       document.execCommand("copy");
     };

238. ### How do you flattening multi dimensional arrays

     Flattening bi-dimensional arrays is trivial with Spread operator.

     ```javascript
     const biDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, 55], [66, 77], 88, 99];
     const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
     ```

     But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,

     ```javascript
     function flattenMultiArray(arr) {
       const flattened = [].concat(...arr);
       return flattened.some((item) => Array.isArray(item))
         ? flattenMultiArray(flattened)
         : flattened;
     }
     const multiDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]];
     const flatArr = flattenMultiArray(multiDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
     ```

     Also you can use the `flat` method of Array.

     ```javascript
     const arr = [1, [2, 3], 4, 5, [6, 7]];
     const fllattenArr = arr.flat(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

     // And for multiDemensional arrays
     const multiDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]];
     const oneStepFlat = multiDimensionalArr.flat(1); // [11, 22, 33, 44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]
     const towStep = multiDimensionalArr.flat(2); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]
     const fullyFlatArray = multiDimensionalArr.flat(Infinity); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]
     ```

239. ### What is the easiest multi condition checking

     You can use `indexOf` to compare input with multiple values instead of checking each value as one condition.

     ```javascript
     // Verbose approach
     if (
       input === "first" ||
       input === 1 ||
       input === "second" ||
       input === 2
     ) {
       someFunction();
     }
     // Shortcut
     if (["first", 1, "second", 2].indexOf(input) !== -1) {
       someFunction();
     }
     ```

240. ### How do you capture browser back button

     The `beforeunload` event is triggered when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded. This event is helpful to warn users about losing the current data and detect back button event.

     ```javascript
      window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
        console.log('Clicked browser back button');
      });
     ```

     You can also use `popstate` event to detect the browser back button. 
     **Note:** The history entry has been activated using `history.pushState` method.

     ```javascript
     window.addEventListener('popstate', () => {
        console.log('Clicked browser back button');
        box.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
      });

     const box = document.getElementById('div');

     box.addEventListener('click', () => {
      box.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
      window.history.pushState({}, null, null);
     });
     ```

    In the preceeding code, When the box element clicked, its background color appears in blue color and changed to while color upon clicking the browser back button using `popstate` event handler. The `state` property of `popstate` contains the copy of history entry's state object.

242. ### What are wrapper objects

     Primitive Values like string,number and boolean don't have properties and methods but they are temporarily converted or coerced to an object(Wrapper object) when you try to perform actions on them. For example, if you apply toUpperCase() method on a primitive string value, it does not throw an error but returns uppercase of the string.

     ```javascript
     let name = "john";

     console.log(name.toUpperCase()); // Behind the scenes treated as console.log(new String(name).toUpperCase());
     ```

     i.e, Every primitive except null and undefined have Wrapper Objects and the list of wrapper objects are String,Number,Boolean,Symbol and BigInt.

245. ### How to cancel a fetch request

     Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.
     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,

     1. Create an `AbortController` instance
     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal
     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal
        For example, let's pass the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,

     ```javascript
     const controller = new AbortController();
     const { signal } = controller;

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
       .then((response) => {
         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);
       })
       .catch((e) => {
         if (e.name === "AbortError") {
           // We know it's been canceled!
         }
       });

     fetch("http://localhost:8000", { signal })
       .then((response) => {
         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);
       })
       .catch((e) => {
         if (e.name === "AbortError") {
           // We know it's been canceled!
         }
       });

     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests
     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);
     ```

246. ### What is web speech API

     Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API has been introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts,

     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.
        The below example shows on how to use this API to get text from speech,

     ```javascript
     window.SpeechRecognition =
       window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF
     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
     recognition.onresult = (event) => {
       // SpeechRecognitionEvent type
       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
       console.log(speechToText);
     };
     recognition.start();
     ```

     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone

     2. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.
        For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,

     ```javascript
     if ("speechSynthesis" in window) {
       var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Hello World!");
       speech.lang = "en-US";
       window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);
     }
     ```

     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.
     **Note:** This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)

247. ### What is minimum timeout throttling

     Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously.
     **Browsers:** They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals.
     Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms.
     **Nodejs:** They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.
     The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.

     ```javascript
     function runMeFirst() {
       console.log("My script is initialized");
     }
     setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);
     console.log("Script loaded");
     ```

     and the output would be in

     ```cmd
     Script loaded
     My script is initialized
     ```

     If you don't use `setTimeout`, the order of logs will be sequential.

     ```javascript
     function runMeFirst() {
       console.log("My script is initialized");
     }
     runMeFirst();
     console.log("Script loaded");
     ```

     and the output is,

     ```cmd
     My script is initialized
     Script loaded
     ```

248. ### How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers

     You can't use setTimeout(fn, 0) to execute the code immediately due to minimum delay of greater than 0ms. But you can use window.postMessage() to achieve this behavior.

     A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue.
     Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,

     1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the `<script>` element, the task will be added to the task queue.
     2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue
     3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue

250. ### What is microtask

     Microtask is the javascript code which needs to be executed immediately after the currently executing task/microtask is completed. They are kind of blocking in nature. i.e, The main thread will be blocked until the microtask queue is empty.
     The main sources of microtasks are Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, MutationObservers, IntersectionObservers etc

     **Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop.

251. ### What are different event loops

     In JavaScript, there are multiple event loops that can be used depending on the context of your application. The most common event loops are:

     1. The Browser Event Loop
     2. The Node.js Event Loop


    - Browser Event Loop: The Browser Event Loop is used in client-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the browser environment, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses, etc.), HTTP requests, and other asynchronous actions.

    - The Node.js Event Loop is used in server-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the Node.js runtime environment, such as file I/O, network I/O, and other asynchronous actions.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

390. ### What is the purpose of queueMicrotask

     The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.

     Example:

     ```javascript
     console.log("Start"); //1

     queueMicrotask(() => {
       console.log("Inside microtask"); // 3
     });

     console.log("End"); //2
     ```

     By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks.

391. ### How do you use javascript libraries in typescript file

     It is known that not all JavaScript libraries or frameworks have TypeScript declaration files. But if you still want to use libraries or frameworks in our TypeScript files without getting compilation errors, the only solution is `declare` keyword along with a variable declaration. For example, let's imagine you have a library called `customLibrary` that doesn’t have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called `customLibrary` in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,

     ```javascript
     declare var customLibrary;
     ```

     In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the `customLibrary` variable as `any` type. The another alternative without using declare keyword is below

     ```javascript
     var customLibrary: any;
     ```

392. ### What are the differences between promises and observables

     Some of the major difference in a tabular form

     | Promises                                                           | Observables                                                                              |
     | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
     | Emits only a single value at a time                                | Emits multiple values over a period of time(stream of values ranging from 0 to multiple) |
     | Eager in nature; they are going to be called immediately           | Lazy in nature; they require subscription to be invoked                                  |
     | Promise is always asynchronous even though it resolved immediately | Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous                                     |
     | Doesn't provide any operators                                      | Provides operators such as map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen etc        |
     | Cannot be canceled                                                 | Canceled by using unsubscribe() method                                                   |

393. ### What is heap

     Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.
     Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.

394. ### What is an event table

     Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table.
     It doesn't not execute functions on it’s own. The main purpose of the event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.

     ![Screenshot](images/event-table.png)

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

395. ### What is a microTask queue

     Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue.
     The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for a long time then it leads to visual degradation.

396. ### What is the difference between shim and polyfill

     A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9).
     Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.
     In a simple sentence, A polyfill is a shim for a browser API.

397. ### How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type

     In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,

     ```javascript
     var myPrimitive = 30;
     var myNonPrimitive = {};
     function isPrimitive(val) {
       return Object(val) !== val;
     }

     isPrimitive(myPrimitive);
     isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);
     ```

     If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object.

398. ### What is babel

     Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,

     1. Transform syntax
     2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill)
     3. Source code transformations (or codemods)

399. ### Is Node.js completely single threaded

     Node is a single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed and performance of a program.

400. ### What are the common use cases of observables

     Some of the most common use cases of observables are web sockets with push notifications, user input changes, repeating intervals, etc

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

401. ### What is RxJS

     RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for implementing reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. It also provides utility functions for creating and working with observables.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

402. ### What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration

     The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.

     Let's see this difference with an example,

     **Function Constructor:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
       var a = 200;
       return new Function("return a;");
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 100
     ```

     **Function declaration:**

     ```javascript
     var a = 100;
     function createFunction() {
       var a = 200;
       return function func() {
         return a;
       };
     }
     console.log(createFunction()()); // 200
     ```

403. ### What is a Short circuit condition

     Short circuit conditions are meant for condensed way of writing simple if statements. Let's demonstrate the scenario using an example. If you would like to login to a portal with an authentication condition, the expression would be as below,

     ```javascript
     if (authenticate) {
       loginToPorta();
     }
     ```

     Since the javascript logical operators evaluated from left to right, the above expression can be simplified using && logical operator

     ```javascript
     authenticate && loginToPorta();
     ```

404. ### What is the easiest way to resize an array

     The length property of an array is useful to resize or empty an array quickly. Let's apply length property on number array to resize the number of elements from 5 to 2,

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     console.log(array.length); // 5

     array.length = 2;
     console.log(array.length); // 2
     console.log(array); // [1,2]
     ```

     and the array can be emptied too

     ```javascript
     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     array.length = 0;
     console.log(array.length); // 0
     console.log(array); // []
     ```

405. ### What is an observable

     An Observable is basically a function that can return a stream of values either synchronously or asynchronously to an observer over time. The consumer can get the value by calling `subscribe()` method.
     Let's look at a simple example of an Observable

     ```javascript
     import { Observable } from "rxjs";

     const observable = new Observable((observer) => {
       setTimeout(() => {
         observer.next("Message from a Observable!");
       }, 3000);
     });

     observable.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
     ```

     ![Screenshot](images/observables.png)

     **Note:** Observables are not part of the JavaScript language yet but they are being proposed to be added to the language

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

406. ### What is the difference between function and class declarations

     The main difference between function declarations and class declarations is `hoisting`. The function declarations are hoisted but not class declarations.

     **Classes:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // ReferenceError

     class User {}
     ```

     **Constructor Function:**

     ```javascript
     const user = new User(); // No error

     function User() {}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

407. ### What is an async function

     An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.

     Let's take a below async function example,

     ```javascript
     async function logger() {
       let data = await fetch("http://someapi.com/users"); // pause until fetch returns
       console.log(data);
     }
     logger();
     ```

     It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

408. ### How do you prevent promises swallowing errors

     While using asynchronous code, JavaScript’s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.

     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,

     ```javascript
     Promise.resolve("promised value").then(function () {
       throw new Error("error");
     });

     Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {
       throw new Error("error");
     });

     new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       throw new Error("error");
     });
     ```

     But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,

     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve("promised value")
          .then(function () {
            throw new Error("error");
          })
          .catch(function (error) {
            console.error(error.stack);
          });
        ```

        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.

     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method

        ```javascript
        Promise.resolve("promised value").done(function () {
          throw new Error("error");
        });
        ```

        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,

        ```javascript
        getDataFromHttp()
          .then(function (result) {
            return processDataAsync(result);
          })
          .done(function (processed) {
            displayData(processed);
          });
        ```

        In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,

        ```javascript
        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {
          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));
        });
        ```

        and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.

     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**
        Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections

        ```javascript
        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {
          throw error;
        });
        ```

        and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch

        ```javascript
        Promise.reject("error value").catch(function () {});
        ```

410. ### How do you make an object iterable in javascript

     By default, plain objects are not iterable. But you can make the object iterable by defining a `Symbol.iterator` property on it.

     Let's demonstrate this with an example,

     ```javascript
     const collection = {
       one: 1,
       two: 2,
       three: 3,
       [Symbol.iterator]() {
         const values = Object.keys(this);
         let i = 0;
         return {
           next: () => {
             return {
               value: this[values[i++]],
               done: i > values.length,
             };
           },
         };
       },
     };

     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();

     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 1, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 2, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 3, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: undefined, done: true}
     ```

     The above process can be simplified using a generator function,

     ```javascript
     const collection = {
       one: 1,
       two: 2,
       three: 3,
       [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
         for (let key in this) {
           yield this[key];
         }
       },
     };
     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 1, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}
     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

411. ### What is a Proper Tail Call

     First, we should know about tail call before talking about "Proper Tail Call". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.

     For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`

     ```javascript
     function factorial(n) {
       if (n === 0) {
         return 1;
       }
       return n * factorial(n - 1);
     }
     console.log(factorial(5)); //120
     ```

     But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.

     ```javascript
     function factorial(n, acc = 1) {
       if (n === 0) {
         return acc;
       }
       return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);
     }
     console.log(factorial(5)); //120
     ```

     The above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls.

412. ### How do you check an object is a promise or not

     If you don't know if a value is a promise or not, wrapping the value as `Promise.resolve(value)` which returns a promise

     ```javascript
     function isPromise(object) {
       if (Promise && Promise.resolve) {
         return Promise.resolve(object) == object;
       } else {
         throw "Promise not supported in your environment";
       }
     }

     var i = 1;
     var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       resolve();
     });

     console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
     console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
     ```

     Another way is to check for `.then()` handler type

     ```javascript
     function isPromise(value) {
       return Boolean(value && typeof value.then === "function");
     }
     var i = 1;
     var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
       resolve();
     });

     console.log(isPromise(i)); // false
     console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true
     ```

413. ### How to detect if a function is called as constructor

     You can use `new.target` pseudo-property to detect whether a function was called as a constructor(using the new operator) or as a regular function call.

     1. If a constructor or function invoked using the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or function.
     2. For function calls, new.target is undefined.

     ```javascript
     function Myfunc() {
       if (new.target) {
         console.log("called with new");
       } else {
         console.log("not called with new");
       }
     }

     new Myfunc(); // called with new
     Myfunc(); // not called with new
     Myfunc.call({}); // not called with new
     ```

414. ### What are the differences between arguments object and rest parameter

     There are three main differences between arguments object and rest parameters

     1. The arguments object is an array-like but not an array. Whereas the rest parameters are array instances.
     2. The arguments object does not support methods such as sort, map, forEach, or pop. Whereas these methods can be used in rest parameters.
     3. The rest parameters are only the ones that haven’t been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

415. ### What are the differences between spread operator and rest parameter

     Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the spread operator.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

416. ### What are the different kinds of generators

     There are five kinds of generators,

     1. **Generator function declaration:**

        ```javascript
        function* myGenFunc() {
          yield 1;
          yield 2;
          yield 3;
        }
        const genObj = myGenFunc();
        ```

     2. **Generator function expressions:**

        ```javascript
        const myGenFunc = function* () {
          yield 1;
          yield 2;
          yield 3;
        };
        const genObj = myGenFunc();
        ```

     3. **Generator method definitions in object literals:**

        ```javascript
        const myObj = {
          *myGeneratorMethod() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          },
        };
        const genObj = myObj.myGeneratorMethod();
        ```

     4. **Generator method definitions in class:**

        ```javascript
        class MyClass {
          *myGeneratorMethod() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          }
        }
        const myObject = new MyClass();
        const genObj = myObject.myGeneratorMethod();
        ```

     5. **Generator as a computed property:**

        ```javascript
        const SomeObj = {
          *[Symbol.iterator]() {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
          },
        };

        console.log(Array.from(SomeObj)); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
        ```

417. ### What are the built-in iterables

     Below are the list of built-in iterables in javascript,

     1. Arrays and TypedArrays
     2. Strings: Iterate over each character or Unicode code-points
     3. Maps: iterate over its key-value pairs
     4. Sets: iterates over their elements
     5. arguments: An array-like special variable in functions
     6. DOM collection such as NodeList

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

418. ### What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements

     Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. The only difference is over what they iterate:

     1. for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object
     2. for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.

     Let's explain this difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     let arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

     arr.newProp = "newVlue";

     // key are the property keys
     for (let key in arr) {
       console.log(key); // 0, 1, 2 & newValue
     }

     // value are the property values
     for (let value of arr) {
       console.log(value); // a, b, c
     }
     ```

     Since for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object, the first loop logs 0, 1, 2 and newProp while iterating over the array object. The for..of loop iterates over the values of a arr data structure and logs a, b, c in the console.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

419. ### How do you define instance and non-instance properties

     The Instance properties must be defined inside of class methods. For example, name and age properties defined inside constructor as below,

     ```javascript
     class Person {
       constructor(name, age) {
         this.name = name;
         this.age = age;
       }
     }
     ```

     But Static(class) and prototype data properties must be defined outside of the ClassBody declaration. Let's assign the age value for Person class as below,

     ```javascript
     Person.staticAge = 30;
     Person.prototype.prototypeAge = 40;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

420. ### What is the difference between isNaN and Number.isNaN?

     1. **isNaN**: The global function `isNaN` converts the argument to a Number and returns true if the resulting value is NaN.
     2. **Number.isNaN**: This method does not convert the argument. But it returns true when the type is a Number and value is NaN.

     Let's see the difference with an example,

     ```javascript
     isNaN(‘hello’);   // true
     Number.isNaN('hello'); // false
     ```

421. ### How to invoke an IIFE without any extra brackets?

     Immediately Invoked Function Expressions(IIFE) requires a pair of parenthesis to wrap the function which contains set of statements.

     ```js
     (function (dt) {
       console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());
     })(new Date());
     ```

     Since both IIFE and void operator discard the result of an expression, you can avoid the extra brackets using `void operator` for IIFE as below,

     ```js
     void (function (dt) {
       console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());
     })(new Date());
     ```

422. ### Is that possible to use expressions in switch cases?

     You might have seen expressions used in switch condition but it is also possible to use for switch cases by assigning true value for the switch condition. Let's see the weather condition based on temparature as an example,

     ```js
     const weather = (function getWeather(temp) {
       switch (true) {
         case temp < 0:
           return "freezing";
         case temp < 10:
           return "cold";
         case temp < 24:
           return "cool";
         default:
           return "unknown";
       }
     })(10);
     ```

423. ### What is the easiest way to ignore promise errors?

     The easiest and safest way to ignore promise errors is void that error. This approach is ESLint friendly too.

     ```js
     await promise.catch((e) => void e);
     ```

424. ### How do style the console output using CSS?

     You can add CSS styling to the console output using the CSS format content specifier %c. The console string message can be appended after the specifier and CSS style in another argument. Let's print the red the color text using console.log and CSS specifier as below,

     ```js
     console.log("%cThis is a red text", "color:red");
     ```

     It is also possible to add more styles for the content. For example, the font-size can be modified for the above text

     ```js
     console.log(
       "%cThis is a red text with bigger font",
       "color:red; font-size:20px"
     );
     ```

425. ### What is nullish coalescing operator (??)?

     It is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. This can be contrasted with the logical OR (||) operator, which returns the right-hand side operand if the left operand is any falsy value, not only null or undefined.

     ```js
     console.log(null ?? true); // true
     console.log(false ?? true); // false
     console.log(undefined ?? true); // true
     ```

426. ### How do you group and nest console output?

     The `console.group()` can be used to group related log messages to be able to easily read the logs and use console.groupEnd()to close the group. Along with this, you can also nest groups which allows to output message in hierarchical manner.

     For example, if you’re logging a user’s details:

     ```js
     console.group("User Details");
     console.log("name: Sudheer Jonna");
     console.log("job: Software Developer");

     // Nested Group
     console.group("Address");
     console.log("Street: Commonwealth");
     console.log("City: Los Angeles");
     console.log("State: California");

     // Close nested group
     console.groupEnd();

     // Close outer group
     console.groupEnd();
     ```

     You can also use `console.groupCollapsed()` instead of `console.group()` if you want the groups to be collapsed by default.

427. ### What is the difference between dense and sparse arrays?

     An array contains items at each index starting from first(0) to last(array.length - 1) is called as Dense array. Whereas if at least one item is missing at any index, the array is called as sparse.

     Let's see the below two kind of arrays,

     ```js
     const avengers = ["Ironman", "Hulk", "CaptainAmerica"];
     console.log(avengers[0]); // 'Ironman'
     console.log(avengers[1]); // 'Hulk'
     console.log(avengers[2]); // 'CaptainAmerica'
     console.log(avengers.length); // 3

     const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", , "Batman"];
     console.log(justiceLeague[0]); // 'Superman'
     console.log(justiceLeague[1]); // 'Aquaman'
     console.log(justiceLeague[2]); // undefined
     console.log(justiceLeague[3]); // 'Batman'
     console.log(justiceLeague.length); // 4
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

428. ### What are the different ways to create sparse arrays?

     There are 4 different ways to create sparse arrays in JavaScript

     1. **Array literal:** Omit a value when using the array literal
        ```js
        const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", , "Batman"];
        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', empty ,'Batman']
        ```
     2. **Array() constructor:** Invoking Array(length) or new Array(length)
        ```js
        const array = Array(3);
        console.log(array); // [empty, empty ,empty]
        ```
     3. **Delete operator:** Using delete array[index] operator on the array
        ```js
        const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", "Batman"];
        delete justiceLeague[1];
        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', empty, ,'Batman']
        ```
     4. **Increase length property:** Increasing length property of an array
        ```js
        const justiceLeague = ["Superman", "Aquaman", "Batman"];
        justiceLeague.length = 5;
        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', 'Batman', empty, empty]
        ```

429. ### What is the difference between setTimeout, setImmediate and process.nextTick?

     1. **Set Timeout:** setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.
     2. **Set Immediate:** The setImmediate function is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.
     3. **Process NextTick:** If process.nextTick() is called in a given phase, all the callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop continues. This will block the event loop and create I/O Starvation if process.nextTick() is called recursively.

430. ### How do you reverse an array without modifying original array?

     The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in an array but it mutates the original array. Let's take a simple example to demonistrate this case,

     ```javascript
     const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     const newArray = originalArray.reverse();

     console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     console.log(originalArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```

     There are few solutions that won't mutate the original array. Let's take a look.

     1. **Using slice and reverse methods:**
        In this case, just invoke the `slice()` method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     2. **Using spread and reverse methods:**
        In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     3. **Using reduce and spread methods:**
        Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {
          return [value, ...accumulator];
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     4. **Using reduceRight and spread methods:**
        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
          return [...accumulator, value];
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

     5. **Using reduceRight and push methods:**
        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator

        ```javascript
        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {
          accumulator.push(value);
          return accumulator;
        }, []);

        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```

431. ### How do you create custom HTML element?

     The creation of custom HTML elements involves two main steps,

     1. **Define your custom HTML element:** First you need to define some custom class by extending HTMLElement class.
        After that define your component properties (styles,text etc) using `connectedCallback` method.
        **Note:** The browser exposes a function called `customElements.define` inorder to reuse the element.
        ```javascript
        class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {
          connectedCallback() {
            this.innerHTML = "This is a custom element";
          }
        }
        customElements.define("custom-element", CustomElement);
        ```
     2. **Use custome element just like other HTML element:** Declare your custom element as a HTML tag.

     ```javascript
        <body>
             <custom-element>
        </body>
     ```

432. ### What is global execution context?

     The global execution context is the default or first execution context that is created by the JavaScript engine before any code is executed(i.e, when the file first loads in the browser). All the global code that is not inside a function or object will be executed inside this global execution context. Since JS engine is single threaded there will be only one global environment and there will be only one global execution context.

     For example, the below code other than code inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.

     ```javascript
     var x = 10;

     function A() {
       console.log("Start function A");

       function B() {
         console.log("In function B");
       }

       B();
     }

     A();

     console.log("GlobalContext");
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

433. ### What is function execution context?

     Whenever a function is invoked, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the Global Execution Context (GEC) to evaluate and execute the code within that function.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

434. ### What is debouncing?

     Debouncing is a programming pattern that allows delaying execution of some piece of code until a specified time to avoid unnecessary _CPU cycles, API calls and improve performance_. The debounce function make sure that your code is only triggered once per user input. The common usecases are Search box suggestions, text-field auto-saves, and eliminating double-button clicks.

     Let's say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it. So here you write a debounce function where the user keeps writing the characters with in 500ms then previous timer cleared out using `clearTimeout` and reschedule API call/DB query for a new time—300 ms in the future.

     ```js
     function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {
       let timer;
       return (...args) => {
         clearTimeout(timer);
         timer = setTimeout(() => {
           func.apply(this, args);
         }, timeout);
       };
     }
     function fetchResults() {
       console.log("Fetching input suggestions");
     }
     const processChange = debounce(() => fetchResults());
     ```

     The _debounce()_ function can be used on input, button and window events

     **Input:**

     ```html
     <input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />
     ```

     **Button:**

     ```html
     <button onclick="processChange()">Click me</button>
     ```

     **Windows event:**

     ```html
     window.addEventListener("scroll", processChange);
     ```

435. ### What is throttling?

     Throttling is a technique used to limit the execution of an event handler function, even when this event triggers continuously due to user actions. The common use cases are browser resizing, window scrolling etc.

     The below example creates a throttle function to reduce the number of events for each pixel change and trigger scroll event for each 100ms except for the first event.

     ```js
     const throttle = (func, limit) => {
       let inThrottle;
       return (...args) => {
         if (!inThrottle) {
           func.apply(this, args);
           inThrottle = true;
           setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
         }
       };
     };
     window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
       throttle(handleScrollAnimation, 100);
     });
     ```

436. ### What is optional chaining?

     According to MDN official docs, the optional chaining operator (?.) permits reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.

     The ?. operator is like the . chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined. When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does not exist.

     ```js
     const adventurer = {
       name: "Alice",
       cat: {
         name: "Dinah",
       },
     };

     const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
     console.log(dogName);
     // expected output: undefined

     console.log(adventurer.someNonExistentMethod?.());
     // expected output: undefined
     ```

437. ### What is an environment record?

     According to ECMAScript specification 262 (9.1):

     > [Environment Record](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-environment-records) is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions, based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code.

     Usually an Environment Record is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement.

     Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.

438. ### How to verify if a variable is an array?

     It is possible to check if a variable is an array instance using 3 different ways,

     1. Array.isArray() method:

        The `Array.isArray(value)` utility function is used to determine whether value is an array or not. This function returns a true boolean value if the variable is an array and a false value if it is not.

        ```javascript
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const user = { name: "John" };
        Array.isArray(numbers); // true
        Array.isArray(user); //false
        ```

     2. instanceof operator:

        The instanceof operator is used to check the type of an array at run time. It returns true if the type of a variable is an Array other false for other type.

        ```javascript
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const user = { name: "John" };
        console.log(numbers instanceof Array); // true
        console.log(user instanceof Array); // false
        ```

     3. Checking constructor type:

        The constructor property of the variable is used to determine whether the variable Array type or not.

        ```javascript
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
        const user = { name: "John" };
        console.log(numbers.constructor === Array); // true
        console.log(user.constructor === Array); // false
        ```

439. ### What is pass by value and pass by reference?

     Pass-by-value creates a new space in memory and makes a copy of a value. Primitives such as string, number, boolean etc will actually create a new copy. Hence, updating one value doesn't impact the other value. i.e, The values are independent of each other.

     ```javascript
     let a = 5;
     let b = a;

     b++;
     console.log(a, b); //5, 6
     ```

     In the above code snippet, the value of `a` is assigned to `b` and the variable `b` has been incremented. Since there is a new space created for variable `b`, any update on this variable doesn't impact the variable `a`.

     Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.

     ```javascript
     let user1 = {
       name: "John",
       age: 27,
     };
     let user2 = user1;
     user2.age = 30;

     console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30
     ```

     In the above code snippet, updating the `age` property of one object will impact the other property due to the same reference.

440. ### What are the differences between primitives and non-primitives?

     JavaScript language has both primitives and non-primitives but there are few differences between them as below,

     | Primitives                 | Non-primitives       |
     | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
     | These types are predefined | Created by developer |
     | These are immutable        | Mutable              |
     | Compare by value           | Compare by reference |
     | Stored in Stack            | Stored in heap       |
     | Contain certain value      | Can contain NULL too |

441. ### How do you create your own bind method using either call or apply method?

     The custom bind function needs to be created on Function prototype inorder to use it as other builtin functions. This custom function should return a function similar to original bind method and the implementation of inner function needs to use apply method call.

     The function which is going to bind using custom `myOwnBind` method act as the attached function(`boundTargetFunction`) and argument as the object for `apply` method call.

     ```js
     Function.prototype.myOwnBind = function (whoIsCallingMe) {
       if (typeof this !== "function") {
         throw new Error(this + "cannot be bound as it's not callable");
       }
       const boundTargetFunction = this;
       return function () {
         boundTargetFunction.apply(whoIsCallingMe, arguments);
       };
     };

     Some of the major differences between pure and impure function are as below,

| Pure function                       | Impure function                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| It has no side effects              | It causes side effects                                                |
| It is always return the same result | It returns different result on each call                              |
| Easy to read and debug              | Difficult to read and debug because they are affected by extenal code |

445. ### What is referential transparency?

An expression in javascript that can be replaced by its value without affecting the behaviour of the program is called referential transparency. Pure functions are referentially transparent.

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
const multiplyBy2 = (x) => x * 2;

//Now add (2, 3) can be replaced by 5.

multiplyBy2(add(2, 3));
```

446. ### What are the possible side-effects in javascript?

     A side effect is the modification of the state through the invocation of a function or expression. These side effects make our function impure by default. Below are some side effects which make function impure,

- Making an HTTP request. Asynchronous functions such as fetch and promise are impure.
- DOM manipulations
- Mutating the input data
- Printing to a screen or console: For example, console.log() and alert()
- Fetching the current time
- Math.random() calls: Modifies the internal state of Math object

447. ### What are compose and pipe functions?

     The "compose" and "pipe" are two techniques commonly used in functional programming to simplify complex operations and make code more readable. They are not native to JavaScript and higher-order functions. the `compose()` applies right to left any number of functions to the output of the previous function.

448. ### What is module pattern?

     Module pattern is a designed pattern used to wrap a set of variables and functions together in a single scope returned as an object. JavaScript doesn't have access specifiers similar to other languages(Java, Python, etc) to provide private scope. It uses IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression) to allow for private scopes. i.e., a closure that protect variables and methods.

     The module pattern looks like below,

     ```javascript
     (function () {
       // Private variables or functions goes here.

       return {
         // Return public variables or functions here.
       };
     })();
     ```

     Let's see an example of a module pattern for an employee with private and public access,

     ```javascript
     const createEmployee = (function () {
       // Private
       const name = "John";
       const department = "Sales";
       const getEmployeeName = () => name;
       const getDepartmentName = () => department;

       // Public
       return {
         name,
         department,
         getName: () => getEmployeeName(),
         getDepartment: () => getDepartmentName(),
       };
     })();

     console.log(createEmployee.name);
     console.log(createEmployee.department);
     console.log(createEmployee.getName());
     console.log(createEmployee.getDepartment());
     ```

     **Note:** It mimic the concepts of classes with private variables and methods.

449. ### What is Function Composition?

     It is an approach where the result of one function is passed on to the next function, which is passed to another until the final function is executed for the final result.

     ```javascript
     //example
     const double = (x) => x * 2;
     const square = (x) => x * x;

     var output1 = double(2);
     var output2 = square(output1);
     console.log(output2);

     var output_final = square(double(2));
     console.log(output_final);
     ```

450. ### How to use await outside of async function prior to ES2022?

     Prior to ES2022, if you attempted to use an await outside of an async function resulted in a SyntaxError.

     ```javascript
     await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); // SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function
     ```

     But you can fix this issue with an alternative IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to get access to the feature.

     ```javascript
     (async function () {
       await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); // Hello await
     })();
     ```

     In ES2022, you can write top-level await without writing any hacks.

     ```javascript
     await Promise.resolve(console.log("Hello await")); //Hello await
     ```

451. ### What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?
* The `this` keyword in JavaScript is a special variable that is used within a function to refer to the object on which the function is invoked. The value of this depends on how the function is called. It allows functions to access and interact with the object they are bound to.
* The this keyword in JavaScript is a reference to the object that owns or invokes the current function. Its value is determined by the calling context.
**Example 1: this in a Global Context**
```javascript
console.log(this);
```
* In a global context, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser).

**Example 2: this in a Function**
```javascript
function displayThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

displayThis();
```
*  In a regular function, this refers to the global object.

**Example 3: this in a Method**
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
  }
};

person.greet();
```
* In a method, this refers to the object that owns the method (person in the case).

**Example 4: this in an Event Handler**
```javascript
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log(this);
});
```
*  In an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event (the button in this case).

var car = new Vehicle("Honda", "white", "2010", "UK");
console.log(car);

function Vehicle(model, color, year, country) {
  this.model = model;
  this.color = color;
  this.year = year;
  this.country = country;
}
```

- 2: ReferenceError: X is not defined
- 3: 1, undefined and number
- 4: 1, number and number

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to the increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,

```javascript
let x;
window.y = 0;
x = window.y;
```

Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The statements order is based on the event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the first statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The console.log for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

This is due to the float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition operations on them lead to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating points doesn't give expected results.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The main points in the above code snippets are,

1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as

```javascript
var y = 1;
if ("foo") {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

##### Answer: 3

This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.

```javascript
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World",
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}

- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

##### Answer: 2

In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

**Note:** In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function

```javascript
const func = function () {
  return arguments.length;
};
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```

But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

##### Answer: 2

In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

The concatenation operator(+) is applicable for both number and string types. So if any operand is string type then both operands concatenated as strings. Whereas subtract(-) operator tries to convert the operands as number type.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); // 4

console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); // true

Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 4

The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a `.then` callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

```javascript
function func() {
  return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined);
}
```

The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.

async function processArray(array) {
  for (const item of array) {
    await delayedLog(item);

Symbol follows below conventions,

1. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string.
2. `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

**Note:** The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The return value of `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString` is always a truthy value (either "number" or "string"). The ! operator operates on either `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString`, converting them to boolean values. Since the value of both `!typeof myNumber` and `!typeof myString` is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.

To make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:

```
if (!(typeof myNumber === "string"))
```

Or simply use the inequality operator:

```
if (typeof myNumber !== "string")
```

The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).

If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,

1. **Pass at least an empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area({});
```

2. **Assign default empty object:**

```javascript

  console.log(length * width);
}

If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.

The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break & return), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second loop doesn't print any value.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

11 and 10 is logged to the console.

The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.
Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.

Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope.

##### Answer: 3

Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its **.then/catch/finally** handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.

**Note:** We call the above queue as "MicroTask Queue"

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon based on a set of rules called `Automatic Semicolon Insertion` which determines whether line break as end of statement or not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.

```javascript
console
  .log("First line")
  [("a", "b", "c")].forEach((element) => console.log(element));
```

Hence, there will be **cannot read properties of undefined** error while applying the array square bracket on log function.

In JavaScript, `of` is not considered as a reserved keyword. So the variable declaration with `of` is accepted and prints the array value `of` using for..of loop.

But if you use reserved keyword such as `in` then there will be a syntax error saying `SyntaxError: Unexpected token in`,

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 2

By default, the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. This is because elemented converted to strings and strings compared in UTF-16 code units order. Hence, you will see the above numbers not sorted as expected. In order to sort numerically just supply a comparator function which handles numeric sorts.

```javascript
const numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers);

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

When the JavaScript engine parses the above code, the first two statements are asynchronous which will be executed later and third statement is synchronous statement which will be moved to callstack, executed and prints the number 3 in the console. Next, Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in the execution order. At last, since setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and executed. Hence, you will see number 2 printed first followed by 1.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

##### Answer: 3

Due to hositing feature, the variables declared with `var` will have `undefined` value in the creation phase so the outer variable `currentCity` will get same `undefined` value. But after few lines of code JavaScript engine found a new function call(`changeCurrentCity()`) to update the current city with `var` re-declaration. Since each function call will create a new execution context, the same variable will have `undefined` value before the declaration and new value(`Singapore`) after the declarion. Hence, the value `undefined` print first followed by new value `Singapore` in the execution phase.

- 4: {name: "John", eat: f}, Window {...}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

`this` keyword is dynamic scoped but not lexically scoped . In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been written but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function so `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have default `Window` object.

The above pit fall fixed by three ways,

1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this` object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var eatFruit = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
    eatFruit();
  },
};
user.eat();
```

The next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced.

2.  It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this` keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var self = this;
    var eatFruit = () => {
      console.log(self);
    };
    eatFruit();
  },
};
user.eat();
```

3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var eatFruit = function () {
      console.log(this);
    };
    return eatFruit.bind(this);
  },
};
user.eat()();

##### Answer: 3

In JavaScript, primitives are immutable i.e. there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created. So when you try to update the string's first character, there is no change in the string value and prints the same initial value `Hello World!`. Whereas in the later example, the concatenated value is re-assigned to the same variable which will result into creation of new memory block with the reference pointing to `John Smith` value and the old memory block value(`John`) will be garbage collected.

When you try to compare two objects with same content, it is going to compare memory address or reference of those variables. These variables always create separate memory blocks hence the comparison is always going to return false value.

##### Answer: 3

The variable `message` is still treated as closure(since it has been used in inner function) eventhough it has been declared after setTimeout function. The function with in setTimeout function will be sent to WebAPI and the variable declaration executed with in 5 seconds with the assigned value. Hence, the text declared for the variable will be displayed.

##### Answer: 1

Eventhough both variables `a` and `b` refer a number value, the first declaration is based on constructor function and the type of the variable is going to be `object` type. Whereas the second declaration is primitive assignment with a number and the type is `number` type. Hence, the equality operator `===` will output `false` value.

##### Answer: 2

Eventhough the above function returns the same result for the same arguments(input) that are passed in the function, the `console.log()` statement causes a function to have side effects because it affects the state of an external code. i.e, the `console` object's state and depends on it to perform the job. Hence, the above function considered as impure function.
