Let's break down the provided JavaScript quiz step by step to understand the behavior of `this` in different contexts within the `obj` object.

### Code:

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: this.a + 1,
  c: () => this.a + 1,
  d() {
    return this.a + 1;
  },
  e() {
    return (() => this.a + 1)();
  },
};

console.log(obj.b);
console.log(obj.c());
console.log(obj.d());
console.log(obj.e());
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **`obj.b`**:

```javascript
b: this.a + 1,
```

- **Key Concept**:
  - The value of `b` is set during the creation of `obj`. However, `this.a + 1` is evaluated **in the context of the global object**, not `obj`, because itâ€™s directly assigned in the object literal.
  - **In non-strict mode**, `this` refers to the **global object** (`window` in a browser). In the global context, `this.a` is `undefined` (since `a` is not a property of the global object), so `this.a + 1` becomes `undefined + 1`.
  - `undefined + 1` results in `NaN` (Not-a-Number).

- **Result**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(obj.b);  // NaN
  ```

#### 2. **`obj.c()`**:

```javascript
c: () => this.a + 1,
```

- **Key Concept**:
  - `c` is an **arrow function**. Arrow functions **don't have their own `this`**; they **lexically inherit `this`** from the surrounding context where they are defined.
  - When `c` is defined, the `this` in the arrow function is bound to the surrounding **global context**, not the `obj` object.
  - Since `this.a` refers to the global object, and there is no `a` in the global context, `this.a` is `undefined`, and `undefined + 1` results in `NaN`.

- **Result**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(obj.c());  // NaN
  ```

#### 3. **`obj.d()`**:

```javascript
d() {
  return this.a + 1;
},
```

- **Key Concept**:
  - `d` is a **regular method** defined on `obj`. When the method is called, `this` refers to the **object `obj`**.
  - Inside `d()`, `this.a` refers to `obj.a`, which is `1`. So `this.a + 1` becomes `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

- **Result**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(obj.d());  // 2
  ```

#### 4. **`obj.e()`**:

```javascript
e() {
  return (() => this.a + 1)();
},
```

- **Key Concept**:
  - `e` is a regular method on `obj`, so `this` inside `e()` refers to `obj`.
  - However, inside `e()`, there is an **arrow function** `() => this.a + 1`. Arrow functions **inherit `this` from the outer context**, which in this case is the method `e`.
  - Since `this` inside `e` refers to `obj`, the arrow function also has `this` referring to `obj`. Therefore, `this.a + 1` inside the arrow function becomes `obj.a + 1`, which is `1 + 1`, so the result is `2`.

- **Result**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(obj.e());  // 2
  ```

### Final Output:

```javascript
NaN  // From obj.b
NaN  // From obj.c()
2    // From obj.d()
2    // From obj.e()
```

### Summary:

- **`obj.b`**: The value is `NaN` because `this.a` refers to the global context, and `this.a` is `undefined`, so `undefined + 1` results in `NaN`.
- **`obj.c()`**: The value is `NaN` because the arrow function inherits `this` from the global context, where `this.a` is `undefined`.
- **`obj.d()`**: The value is `2` because `this` refers to `obj`, and `obj.a` is `1`, so `1 + 1` results in `2`.
- **`obj.e()`**: The value is `2` because the arrow function inside `e()` inherits `this` from `e`, which refers to `obj`, so `obj.a + 1` results in `2`.
