The code you've provided involves both instance-level properties and static properties in JavaScript classes, and you are calling both the instance method and the static method. Let's break down what happens in the code step by step:

### Code Explanation:

```javascript
class A {
  static dev = "BFE";  // Static property of class A
  dev = "bigfrontend"; // Instance property of class A
}

class B extends A {
  log() {
    console.log(this.dev); // Instance method that logs the instance-level 'dev' property
  }

  static log() {
    console.log(this.dev); // Static method that logs the static 'dev' property
  }
}

B.log();         // Call the static method of class B
new B().log();   // Create an instance of B and call the instance method
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Static Property (`static dev`)**:
   - In class `A`, the static property `dev = "BFE"` is defined. This property is tied to the class itself and can be accessed via the class (`A.dev` or `B.dev`).
   - Static properties are not accessible through instances of the class. They belong to the class itself.

2. **Instance Property (`dev`)**:
   - In class `A`, the instance property `dev = "bigfrontend"` is defined. This property is specific to instances of the class and can be accessed via an instance of the class (`this.dev` inside an instance method).
   - Each instance of `A` (or `B`, which inherits from `A`) will have its own `dev` property.

3. **Class B: Inherited Behavior**:
   - Class `B` inherits from class `A`, so it has access to the instance property `dev` from `A` and can also override or use static methods from `A`.
   
4. **Calling `B.log()`**:
   - The static method `log()` in class `B` is called. Inside this method, `this.dev` is accessed. Since `log()` is a static method, `this` refers to the class itself (i.e., `B`).
   - Therefore, `this.dev` will refer to `B.dev`, but since `B` does not have its own static `dev` property, it falls back to `A.dev` (the static property of class `A`).
   - **Output**: `BFE` (because `B` inherits the static property `dev` from `A`).

5. **Calling `new B().log()`**:
   - The instance method `log()` is called on a new instance of class `B`.
   - Inside this instance method, `this.dev` is accessed. Since this method is called on an instance of `B`, `this` refers to the instance of class `B`.
   - The instance of `B` inherits from class `A`, so it has access to the instance property `dev` from `A`, which is `"bigfrontend"`.
   - **Output**: `bigfrontend` (because the instance has its own `dev` property set to `"bigfrontend"`).

### Output:

```javascript
BFE        // From B.log(), static method
bigfrontend // From new B().log(), instance method
```

### Summary:

- `B.log()` calls the static method `log()` of class `B`, which accesses the static property `dev` (inherited from `A`), so the output is `"BFE"`.
- `new B().log()` calls the instance method `log()` of class `B`, which accesses the instance property `dev` (inherited from `A`), so the output is `"bigfrontend"`.
