Let's break down and analyze the provided JavaScript code step by step to understand the behavior of `this` in each case.

### Code:

```javascript
var bar = 1;

function foo() {
  return this.bar++;
}

const a = {
  bar: 10,
  foo1: foo,
  foo2: function () {
    return foo();
  },
};

console.log(a.foo1.call());
console.log(a.foo1());
console.log(a.foo2.call());
console.log(a.foo2());
```

### Key Concepts to Understand:

1. **`this` keyword**:
   - The value of `this` depends on how a function is called.
   - **`call()`**: Explicitly sets `this` inside the function to the first argument passed to `call()`.
   - **Method call**: When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to that object.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `foo` is intended to access `this.bar` and increment it. The key question is what `this` will refer to in each call.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **`console.log(a.foo1.call())`**:

- **Explanation**:
  - `a.foo1` is a reference to the function `foo` (from `foo1: foo`).
  - `.call()` is used to invoke the function with a specific `this` context. However, no argument is passed to `.call()`, so `this` defaults to the **global object** (`window` in a browser or `global` in Node.js).
  - In **non-strict mode**, `this` refers to the global object. Thus, `this.bar++` modifies the global `bar`, which was initially `1`.
  
- **Global `bar`**:
  - The global `bar` is `1` before the call, and it will be incremented to `2` inside the function.
  - The function returns the value before it is incremented, so it returns `1`.

- **Result**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(a.foo1.call()); // 1
  ```

#### 2. **`console.log(a.foo1())`**:

- **Explanation**:
  - Here, `a.foo1()` calls `foo` as a method of the object `a`, so `this` inside `foo` will refer to `a`.
  - `this.bar++` refers to `a.bar`, which was initially `10`.
  - `a.bar` is incremented from `10` to `11`, and the function returns the value before the increment (i.e., `10`).

- **Result**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(a.foo1()); // 10
  ```

#### 3. **`console.log(a.foo2.call())`**:

- **Explanation**:
  - `a.foo2` is a function defined as `foo2: function() { return foo(); }`.
  - In this case, `foo2` invokes `foo` without changing the context explicitly, so `this` inside `foo2` is still the object `a` (since `foo2` is a method of `a`).
  - **However**, inside `foo2`, the call to `foo()` does **not use `.call()`**, so `this` will still be the object `a`, meaning `a.bar` will be incremented.
  
- **Result**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(a.foo2.call()); // 11
  ```

#### 4. **`console.log(a.foo2())`**:

- **Explanation**:
  - `a.foo2()` is calling `foo2` as a method of object `a`, and inside `foo2`, `foo()` is called directly without modifying `this`. Therefore, `this` inside `foo` will refer to `a`, and `a.bar` will be incremented.
  
- **Result**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(a.foo2()); // 12
  ```

### Final Output:

```javascript
1
10
11
12
```

### Detailed Summary of Results:

1. **`a.foo1.call()`**:
   - `this` refers to the global object (`window`), so the global `bar` (initially `1`) is incremented.
   - The return value of `this.bar++` is `1` (the value before increment).

2. **`a.foo1()`**:
   - `this` refers to `a`, so `a.bar` (initially `10`) is incremented.
   - The return value of `a.bar++` is `10` (the value before increment).

3. **`a.foo2.call()`**:
   - Inside `foo2`, `foo()` is called, and `this` still refers to `a` (since `foo2` is a method of `a`).
   - `a.bar` (which was `10`) is incremented, and the return value of `a.bar++` is `11`.

4. **`a.foo2()`**:
   - Similar to the previous case, inside `foo2`, `foo()` is called, and `this` refers to `a`.
   - `a.bar` (which was `11`) is incremented, and the return value of `a.bar++` is `12`.

### Conclusion:
The key takeaway is the importance of how `this` is set. When using `.call()`, `this` refers to the context passed to `.call()`. When calling methods directly, `this` refers to the object on which the method is called. Additionally, variable hoisting and the behavior of the increment operator `++` can sometimes lead to subtle results, especially when it involves object properties or the global object.
