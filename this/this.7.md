Let's break down the provided JavaScript code step by step and understand what happens in each case, particularly focusing on how the `this` keyword behaves in different contexts.

### Code:

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b() {
    return this.a;
  },
};

console.log(obj.b());
console.log((true ? obj.b : a)());
console.log((true, obj.b)());
console.log((3, obj["b"])());
console.log(obj.b());
console.log((obj.c = obj.b)());
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **`console.log(obj.b())`**:

```javascript
console.log(obj.b());
```

- `obj.b()` is a method call on the `obj` object.
- Inside the method `b()`, `this` refers to the object `obj`, so `this.a` is `1`.
- The return value is `1`.

**Output**: 
```javascript
1
```

---

#### 2. **`console.log((true ? obj.b : a)())`**:

```javascript
console.log((true ? obj.b : a)());
```

- This expression uses the **ternary operator** to evaluate `true ? obj.b : a`.
  - Since `true` is truthy, the result of the ternary expression will be `obj.b`.
  - The next step is calling `obj.b()` as a function.
- `obj.b` is a function, but when it's called without being invoked as a method of `obj`, **`this` inside `obj.b()` will refer to the global object**, not `obj`.
  - In **non-strict mode**, `this` refers to the **global object** (`window` in the browser).
  - Since `this.a` is `undefined` in the global object, the result will be `undefined`.
  
**Output**: 
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 3. **`console.log((true, obj.b)())`**:

```javascript
console.log((true, obj.b)());
```

- The **comma operator** `(true, obj.b)` evaluates `true` first (which has no effect) and then evaluates `obj.b`, so the result of this expression is `obj.b`.
- After that, `obj.b()` is called, but since `obj.b` is not invoked as a method of `obj`, **`this` inside `obj.b()` will again refer to the global object**.
  - In the global context, `this.a` is `undefined`, so the result is `undefined`.

**Output**: 
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 4. **`console.log((3, obj["b"])())`**:

```javascript
console.log((3, obj["b"])());
```

- Similar to the previous case, `(3, obj["b"])` uses the comma operator to evaluate `3` first (which does nothing) and then evaluate `obj["b"]`.
- After this, `obj["b"]()` is called, and again, since `obj.b` is not invoked as a method of `obj`, **`this` inside `obj.b()` will refer to the global object**.
  - The result will again be `undefined`, because `this.a` is `undefined` in the global context.

**Output**: 
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 5. **`console.log(obj.b())`**:

```javascript
console.log(obj.b());
```

- This is the same as the first case, where `obj.b()` is called as a method of `obj`.
- Since `this` inside `obj.b()` refers to `obj`, and `obj.a` is `1`, the result is `1`.

**Output**: 
```javascript
1
```

---

#### 6. **`console.log((obj.c = obj.b)())`**:

```javascript
console.log((obj.c = obj.b)());
```

- First, the expression `obj.c = obj.b` assigns the method `obj.b` to `obj.c`.
- The next part of the expression is `obj.c()`, which calls the function that `obj.c` refers to (`obj.b`).
- When `obj.b` is invoked as `obj.c()`, `this` inside `obj.b()` **will refer to `obj`**, because `obj.c` is still a method of `obj`.
  - `this.a` is `1`, so the result is `1`.

**Output**: 
```javascript
1
```

---

### Final Output:

```javascript
1             // obj.b() as a method of obj (this refers to obj)
undefined     // (true ? obj.b : a)() - obj.b is called without a context (this refers to global object)
undefined     // (true, obj.b)() - obj.b is called without a context (this refers to global object)
undefined     // (3, obj["b"])() - obj.b is called without a context (this refers to global object)
1             // obj.b() as a method of obj (this refers to obj)
1             // (obj.c = obj.b)() - obj.b is called as a method of obj (this refers to obj)
```

### Summary:

- **Method call (`obj.b()`)**: When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to the object.
- **Function call without an object (`(obj.b)()`)**: When the method is called as a regular function, `this` refers to the **global object** (in non-strict mode), and accessing `this.a` results in `undefined`.
- **Comma operator (`(3, obj.b)()`)**: Similar to calling the function directly, this results in the global `this`, so `undefined` is returned.
- **Assigning a function to a property (`obj.c = obj.b`)**: When the function is called as a method (`obj.c()`), `this` refers to `obj`, and the result is `1`.
