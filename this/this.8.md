Let's break down the provided JavaScript quiz code step by step to understand how the `this` keyword behaves in different contexts within the object `obj`.

### Code:

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: function () {
    console.log(this.a);
  },
  c() {
    console.log(this.a);
  },
  d: () => {
    console.log(this.a);
  },
  e: (function () {
    return () => {
      console.log(this.a);
    };
  })(),
  f: function () {
    return () => {
      console.log(this.a);
    };
  },
};

console.log(obj.a);
obj.b();
obj.b();
const b = obj.b;
b();
obj.b.apply({ a: 2 });
obj.c();
obj.d();
obj.d();
obj.d.apply({ a: 2 });
obj.e();
obj.e();
obj.e.call({ a: 2 });
obj.f()();
obj.f()();
obj.f().call({ a: 2 });
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **`console.log(obj.a)`**:

```javascript
console.log(obj.a);
```

- This directly accesses the `a` property of `obj`, which is `1`.

**Output**:
```javascript
1
```

---

#### 2. **`obj.b()`** (First call):

```javascript
obj.b();
```

- `b` is a regular method on `obj`. When called as a method, `this` refers to the `obj` object.
- `this.a` refers to `obj.a`, which is `1`.

**Output**:
```javascript
1
```

---

#### 3. **`obj.b()`** (Second call):

```javascript
obj.b();
```

- This is the same as the first call. `this` still refers to `obj`, and the result is `1`.

**Output**:
```javascript
1
```

---

#### 4. **`const b = obj.b; b();`**:

```javascript
const b = obj.b;
b();
```

- `b` is now assigned the reference to `obj.b`. However, calling `b()` will not invoke it as a method of `obj`, so `this` is not bound to `obj`.
- In **non-strict mode**, `this` will refer to the **global object** (e.g., `window` in browsers), and `this.a` is `undefined` because there is no `a` on the global object.

**Output**:
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 5. **`obj.b.apply({ a: 2 })`**:

```javascript
obj.b.apply({ a: 2 });
```

- `apply()` explicitly sets `this`. In this case, `this` inside `obj.b` is set to `{ a: 2 }`, so `this.a` is `2`.

**Output**:
```javascript
2
```

---

#### 6. **`obj.c()`**:

```javascript
obj.c();
```

- `c` is a method of `obj`, and `this` inside `obj.c()` refers to `obj`. Therefore, `this.a` is `1`.

**Output**:
```javascript
1
```

---

#### 7. **`obj.d()`** (First call):

```javascript
obj.d();
```

- `d` is an arrow function. Arrow functions **do not have their own `this`**; they inherit `this` from the surrounding context (where they were defined).
- Since `d` is defined as an arrow function inside the `obj` object, **`this` refers to the `this` in the surrounding context**, which is likely the **global object** (in non-strict mode).
- So, `this.a` will be `undefined` because `this.a` is not defined in the global context.

**Output**:
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 8. **`obj.d()`** (Second call):

```javascript
obj.d();
```

- This is the same as the first call. `this` still refers to the global object, so the result is still `undefined`.

**Output**:
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 9. **`obj.d.apply({ a: 2 })`**:

```javascript
obj.d.apply({ a: 2 });
```

- Arrow functions **cannot have their `this` explicitly set** (via `apply()`, `call()`, etc.), so `this` still refers to the global object, not `{ a: 2 }`.
- The result is still `undefined`.

**Output**:
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 10. **`obj.e()`** (First call):

```javascript
obj.e();
```

- `e` is an **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** that returns an arrow function. Arrow functions inherit `this` from their surrounding context.
- The `this` inside `e` refers to the global context (because of the IIFE).
- As a result, `this.a` is `undefined`.

**Output**:
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 11. **`obj.e()`** (Second call):

```javascript
obj.e();
```

- This is the same as the first call. The result is still `undefined`.

**Output**:
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 12. **`obj.e.call({ a: 2 })`**:

```javascript
obj.e.call({ a: 2 });
```

- The `.call()` method does not affect the `this` inside the arrow function, so it still refers to the global context, not `{ a: 2 }`.
- The result is still `undefined`.

**Output**:
```javascript
undefined
```

---

#### 13. **`obj.f()()`** (First call):

```javascript
obj.f()();
```

- `f` is a regular function, and it returns an arrow function. The regular function `f()` is called with `this` referring to `obj`, so the returned arrow function inherits `this` from `obj`.
- `this.a` inside the returned arrow function refers to `obj.a`, which is `1`.

**Output**:
```javascript
1
```

---

#### 14. **`obj.f()()`** (Second call):

```javascript
obj.f()();
```

- This is the same as the first call. The result is still `1`.

**Output**:
```javascript
1
```

---

#### 15. **`obj.f().call({ a: 2 })`**:

```javascript
obj.f().call({ a: 2 });
```

- `f()` is called, and it returns an arrow function. The arrow function inherits `this` from `f()`, which is `obj`.
- The `call()` method does not affect the `this` inside the arrow function, so `this` inside the arrow function still refers to `obj`, not `{ a: 2 }`.
- `this.a` is `1`.

**Output**:
```javascript
1
```

---

### Final Output:

```javascript
1             // Access obj.a
1             // obj.b() called as method
1             // obj.b() called again as method
undefined     // b() called as standalone function, `this` is global
2             // obj.b.apply({ a: 2 }) - this refers to { a: 2 }
1             // obj.c() called as method
undefined     // obj.d() - arrow function, `this` is global
undefined     // obj.d() - called again, `this` is global
undefined     // obj.d.apply({ a: 2 }) - apply doesn't affect `this` for arrow functions
undefined     // obj.e() - arrow function inside IIFE, `this` is global
undefined     // obj.e() - called again, `this` is global
undefined     // obj.e.call({ a: 2 }) - call doesn't affect `this` for arrow functions
1             // obj.f()() - arrow function inherits `this` from obj
1             // obj.f()() - called again
1             // obj.f().call({ a: 2 }) - call doesn't affect `this` for arrow functions
```

### Summary of Key Points:

- **Regular methods** (`b`, `c`): When called as methods, `this` refers to the object they are part of (i.e., `obj`).
- **Arrow functions** (`d`, `e`): Arrow functions inherit `this` from the surrounding context, which is typically the global context in this case, resulting in `undefined` for `this.a` in non-strict mode.
- **`apply()` and `call()`**: While `apply()` and `call()` can change `this` for regular functions, they **do not work with arrow functions**, as arrow functions always inherit `this` from their lexical scope.
