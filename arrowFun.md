In this code, you're working with a class `Site` that has a method `getHandle()`, which returns an object containing three methods: `getName1`, `getName2`, and `getName3`. Each of these methods behaves differently due to the way they reference `this`.

Let's break down what happens when you run the code:

### 1. **`getName1()`**:
This method is a **regular function**. In JavaScript, the value of `this` inside a regular function is determined by how the function is called. When `getName1` is called as `site.getHandle().getName1()`, `this` refers to the **object returned by `getHandle()`**, not the `Site` instance.

- `this.name` will access `name` from the **object returned by `getHandle()`** (which doesn't have a `name` property, so `this.name` is `undefined`).
  
  ```javascript
  console.log(site.getHandle().getName1()); // undefined
  ```

### 2. **`getName2()`**:
This is an **arrow function**. Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. Instead, they inherit `this` from the surrounding lexical context, i.e., the context in which they were defined. In this case, `getName2` is defined inside the `getHandle()` method, and thus `this` in `getName2` refers to the `Site` instance because `getHandle()` was called on `site` (an instance of `Site`).

- `this.name` in `getName2()` refers to the `name` property of the `Site` instance, which is `"BFE"`.
  
  ```javascript
  console.log(site.getHandle().getName2()); // "BFE"
  ```

### 3. **`getName3()`**:
This method is a **regular function**, but unlike `getName1()`, it is **defined using the function keyword** within the returned object. In this case, `this` will refer to the object the function is called on — which is the object returned by `getHandle()`.

- Since the object returned by `getHandle()` doesn't have a `name` property, `this.name` will be `undefined` again.
  
  ```javascript
  console.log(site.getHandle().getName3()); // undefined
  ```

### Summary of Behavior:
- **`getName1()`**: Since it’s a regular function, `this` refers to the object returned by `getHandle()`, which doesn't have a `name` property. Therefore, `this.name` is `undefined`.
- **`getName2()`**: Since it’s an arrow function, `this` is lexically bound to the `Site` instance (i.e., `site`), so `this.name` refers to `"BFE"`.
- **`getName3()`**: Like `getName1()`, it’s a regular function, so `this` refers to the object returned by `getHandle()`, which doesn't have a `name` property. Therefore, `this.name` is `undefined`.

### The output of the code will be:

```javascript
undefined  // from getName1()
"BFE"      // from getName2()
undefined  // from getName3()
```

### Key Takeaways:
- **Regular functions**: `this` depends on how the function is called.
- **Arrow functions**: `this` is lexically bound and inherited from the surrounding context (the class in this case).
