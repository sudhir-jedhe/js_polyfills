While working on a project a little while back, I came across a problem that made me stop and think. I was trying to check if a truncated HTML string that was serialized from the server had been truncated in the middle of a tag. Naturally, instead of writing a one-off solution, I decided to create a reusable helper function.

Check if a string starts with a substring of another string
String.prototype.startsWith() allows us to easily check if a string starts with a given substring. Unfortunately, in the case of this problem, this is insufficient by itself. Instead, we can use String.prototype.slice() to get each substring of the other string and check it against our text.

If we go from longest to shortest substring of the target string, we are guaranteed to come across the longest substring that the text starts with first. We can then return this substring, if it is found. Otherwise, we can return undefined.

const startsWithSubstring = (text, word) => {
  for (i = word.length; i > 0; i--) {
    const substr = word.slice(-i);
    if (text.startsWith(substr)) return substr;
  }
  return undefined;
};

startsWithSubstring('/>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet', '<br />'); // '/>'
Check if a string ends with a substring of another string
We can use the same approach to check if a string ends with a substring of another string. The only difference is that we need to use String.prototype.endsWith() instead of String.prototype.startsWith() and change the order of iteration of the substrings.

const endsWithSubstring = (text, word) => {
  for (i = word.length; i > 0; i--) {
    const substr = word.slice(0, i);
    if (text.endsWith(substr)) return substr;
  }
  return undefined;
};

endsWithSubstring('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet<br /', '<br />'); // '<br /'
