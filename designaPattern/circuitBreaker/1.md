A circuit breaker is a design pattern that helps to prevent cascading failures. Falling under the sustainable category, it is majorly used on the micro-services but can be implemented on the front-end side as well.

Imagine you are making an API call and the request keeps failing, rather than keep on bombarding the server, we can halt the request sending for a certain time. That is how a circuit breaker works.

We have to implement a function that will halt the operation for X amount of time if it fails for Y count.

This can implemented by forming a closure where we track the count of failure and time since the last failure and based on that decide if the function is available or not.
