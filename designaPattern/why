### **Why Use Design Patterns in JavaScript?**

#### **Introduction**
Design patterns in JavaScript are practical, reusable solutions for recurring problems in software design. They streamline the development process by standardizing approaches to common challenges.

#### **Benefits of Design Patterns**
1. **Easier to Understand**:  
   Patterns organize code, making it more predictable and maintainable. Developers unfamiliar with the project can quickly adapt by recognizing these patterns.
   
2. **Increased Efficiency**:  
   Proven solutions reduce development time and effort by avoiding the need to "reinvent the wheel."
   
3. **Improved Scalability**:  
   Patterns provide a solid foundation that makes expanding a codebase seamless, even as complexity grows.

#### **Types of JavaScript Design Patterns**
1. **Creational Design Patterns (Red Column)**  
   Focus on object creation strategies to suit varying application needs.
   - **Examples**:  
     - **Constructor**: Directly creates class instances.  
     - **Factory**: Dynamically decides which class or object to instantiate.  
     - **Singleton**: Guarantees only one instance of a class exists.  
     - **Builder**: Constructs complex objects incrementally.

2. **Structural Design Patterns (Blue Column)**  
   Simplify code organization and object relationships.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - **Adapter**: Bridges incompatible interfaces.  
     - **Decorator**: Dynamically adds functionality to objects.  
     - **Proxy**: Acts as an intermediary for another object.

3. **Behavioral Design Patterns (Green Column)**  
   Optimize object communication and interaction.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - **Observer**: Enables objects to notify others of state changes.  
     - **Strategy**: Switches algorithms based on runtime conditions.  
     - **Command**: Encapsulates operations as objects.

#### **When to Use Them?**
- **Creational Patterns**: Managing numerous or complex object instantiations.  
- **Structural Patterns**: Refactoring or organizing large codebases.  
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Managing complex workflows or inter-object communication.

### **Design Challenges**

Below is a detailed breakdown of system and product design tasks:

#### **System Design Tasks**

1. **Design an Infinite Scroller**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Efficiently fetch and render data as the user scrolls.  
     - Use intersection observers for optimal performance.  
     - Implement pagination or lazy loading.  
   - **Techniques**: Virtual DOM, debounce/throttle for scroll events.

2. **Design an API Progress Bar**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Track API call progress in real-time.  
     - Display progress with accuracy and handle errors gracefully.  
   - **Techniques**: WebSockets or polling for updates.

3. **Design a Typeahead Widget**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Fetch and display suggestions dynamically as the user types.  
     - Optimize for performance with debouncing.  
   - **Techniques**: REST APIs for fetching suggestions, caching results.

4. **Create a Star Widget**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Handle star ratings (half-stars, hover states).  
     - Allow user interaction and provide feedback.  
   - **Techniques**: CSS for styling, JavaScript for interaction.

5. **Design a Poll Widget**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Allow voting, live updates for poll results.  
     - Secure against duplicate submissions.  
   - **Techniques**: Use Firebase or similar real-time databases.

6. **Design a Carousel Widget**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Support dynamic content.  
     - Implement touch/keyboard navigation and lazy loading.  
   - **Techniques**: CSS transitions, event listeners.

7. **Design a QR Code-Based Login System**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Generate and scan QR codes securely.  
     - Authenticate users via token-based systems.  
   - **Techniques**: Use libraries like `qrcode.js`.

8. **Design Google Analytics Script**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Efficiently track page views and user interactions.  
     - Minimize performance impact on client-side operations.  
   - **Techniques**: Asynchronous scripts and event listeners.

9. **Design a Slider Component**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Smooth transitions and responsiveness.  
     - Support keyboard and mouse interactions.  
   - **Techniques**: CSS animations, JavaScript for dynamic updates.

10. **Implement Nested Checkboxes**  
    - **Key Considerations**:  
      - Dynamically update parent/child check states.  
      - Handle partial selections gracefully.  
    - **Techniques**: Recursive data structures for hierarchy handling.

11. **Design a Tic-Tac-Toe Game**  
    - **Key Considerations**:  
      - Implement logic for gameplay, win conditions, and resets.  
      - Provide an interactive UI.  
    - **Techniques**: Grid-based rendering, state management.

12. **Create a WYSIWYG Editor**  
    - **Key Considerations**:  
      - Support for rich text, images, and custom formatting.  
      - Enable easy extension and plugin support.  
    - **Techniques**: ContentEditable API, custom rendering layers.

#### **Product Design Tasks**

1. **Design Facebook.com**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Handle news feed personalization.  
     - Optimize for large-scale user interactions.

2. **Design Instagram**  
   - **Key Considerations**:  
     - Manage media uploads and real-time updates.  
     - Implement efficient search and recommendation features.
