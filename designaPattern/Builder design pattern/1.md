Builder design pattern which is part of the creational design pattern family is used for the step-by-step creation of the objects.

In object-oriented programming, when a new object is created from the constructor, you can either pass all the arguments or no arguments to the constructor.

class Payment{
 constructor(currency, amount) {
   this.currency = currency;
   this.amount = amount;
 }
}

const a = new Payment();
const b = new Payment('â‚¹', 1000);


While this suffices for many cases, oftentimes we want to build the object once it is created. In that case, we can make use of the builder design pattern.
