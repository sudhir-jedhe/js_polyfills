What is prototype in JavaScript?
Objects in JavaScript are very special, they can be created directly without having a Class defined and the objects have a special property called prototype available to them that holds the reference to the parent that has created it.

If you are declaring an object directly then the prototype will point to the default properties that are available on an object in JavaScript.


What is prototype chain in JavaScript?
When you try to access the methods or properties on the object, the object checks if that instance is available on it or not, if it is not available it will look for the same in the prototype.

This is called a prototype chain where the derived object keeps looking for the properties in its prototype, this really helps in creating a single instance of the property on the constructor making it available to all the derived instances of it.
