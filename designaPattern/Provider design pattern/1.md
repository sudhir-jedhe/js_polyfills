Props drill down is the most expensive way to pass data around the children in Reactjs and also the cause for many bugs, from parent to children to grandchildren, every time the props are passed, it has to be manually written in the child componentâ€™s code for which props has to be passed down further.


const Parent = () => {
  const topic = { title: "Tech", articles: [{ title: "web3", content: "" }] };
  return <Child topic={topic} />;
};

const Child = ({ topic }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title={topic.title} />
      <Main articles={topic.articles} />
    </div>
  );
};

const Header = ({ title }) => {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
    </header>
  );
};

const Main = ({ articles }) => {
  return (
    <section className="articles">
      {articles.map((e) => (
        <article key={e.id}>
          <h1>{e.title}</h1>
          <p>{e.content}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </section>
  );
};
