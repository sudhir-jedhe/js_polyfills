Proxy is the concept of doing things via an intermediatory, for example, if you want to change something in the original source, you hand your changes to your proxy which can do all sorts of validations on it to make sure only legit things are passed and then it forwards to the original source


Proxy design pattern works similarly in JavaScript and it is majorly used with objects, you can use it with other data types as well.

But as the majority of things in JavaScript are objects they can be passed as a reference there is a higher chance that they can be mutated unknowingly creating bugs.

To solve this and add additional constraints JavaScript has introduced a proxy object that provides us the flexibility to create a proxy for another object.

It takes two parameters as input,

Target – The target object that needs to proxied.
Handler – An object that defines the methods that need to be intercepted. Handlers have many different methods such as get, set.


const person = {
  name: "prashant",
  age: 28,
  gender: "male"
};

const proxiedPerson = new Proxy(person, {
  get(){
    // intercept get
  },
  set(){
    // intercept get
  }
});


Now, if you do the implicit or explicit update or access of object properties it will be intercepted, irrespective if you use the dot operator proxiedPerson.name or the square brackets proxiedPerson["name"].
