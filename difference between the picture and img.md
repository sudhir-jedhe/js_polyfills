The difference between the `<picture>` and `<img>` tags in HTML lies in their functionality and use cases. Here’s a detailed comparison:

**1. `<img>` Tag**
Purpose: The `<img>` tag is used to display a single image on a webpage. It’s a simple and straightforward tag for embedding images.
Syntax:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
```
Attributes:
`src`: Specifies the path to the image.
`alt`: Provides alternative text for the image, useful for accessibility and when the image is not loaded.
`width/height:` Sets the image dimensions.
`Use case:` You would use `<img>` when you want to display a single, static image without the need for different image versions for various screen sizes or device capabilities.
**2. `<picture>` Tag**
Purpose: The `<picture>` tag allows you to provide multiple versions of an image, enabling different images to be displayed based on conditions like screen size, image resolution, or device type. It provides greater control over responsive images.
Syntax:
```js
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 800px)">
  <source srcset="image-small.jpg" media="(max-width: 799px)">
  <img src="default-image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
</picture>
```
**Attributes:**
`srcset`: Specifies a list of image sources (can include image sizes).
`media`: Defines the media query for selecting a source image. For example, different images can be shown on different screen sizes or device types.
`img`: The `<picture>` tag must contain an `<img>` tag as a fallback for browsers that don’t support the `<picture>` element.
`Use case`: You would use `<picture>` when you need to serve different image files based on device characteristics like screen size, resolution, or viewport.
**Key Differences:**
**`Flexibility:`**

`<img>` is simpler and used for single images.
`<picture>` is more flexible and allows for multiple sources based on conditions, making it ideal for responsive images.

**`Media Queries:`**

`<img>` does not support media queries.
`<picture>` supports media queries through the `<source>` tag, enabling you to specify different images for different device features.

**`Use in Responsive Design:`**

`<img>` will only display one image, so it's not as effective for responsive design.
`<picture>` is designed specifically for responsive design, allowing images to adjust to different screen sizes and conditions.

Example Scenario:
If you want a small image on mobile devices and a larger image on desktops, you would use the `<picture>` tag:
```js
<picture>
  <source srcset="desktop-image.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)">
  <img src="mobile-image.jpg" alt="A responsive image">
</picture>
```
In conclusion, use the `<img>` tag for simple, static images, and the `<picture>` tag when you need to serve different images based on device or screen size, providing a more responsive and adaptive experience.
