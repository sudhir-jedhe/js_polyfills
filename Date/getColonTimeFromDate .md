Your `getColonTimeFromDate` function is correctly extracting the time in `HH:mm:ss` format from a JavaScript `Date` object.

### Explanation:
- `date.toTimeString()` returns a string that represents the time portion of the date in the format: `HH:mm:ss GMTÂ±hhmm (Timezone Name)`.
- `.slice(0, 8)` slices the string to grab only the first 8 characters, which correspond to the `HH:mm:ss` part of the time.

### Example:

```javascript
const getColonTimeFromDate = date => date.toTimeString().slice(0, 8);

console.log(getColonTimeFromDate(new Date())); // '08:38:00' (example output)
```

This will output the current time in `HH:mm:ss` format (based on your system's local time).

### Points to Note:
- `toTimeString()` might include time zone information after the time (e.g., `GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)`), but by slicing only the first 8 characters, we ensure that we only get the `HH:mm:ss` part.
- This method works well in browsers and most environments where `Date` objects use `toTimeString()` in the expected format.

If you need to ensure consistent behavior regardless of time zone or locale, you could also use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` as a more robust alternative, but the current approach should work for most cases.
