```js
const dateRangeGenerator = function* (start, end, step = 1) {
  let d = start;
  while (d < end) {
    yield new Date(d);
    d.setDate(d.getDate() + step);
  }
};

[...dateRangeGenerator(new Date("2021-06-01"), new Date("2021-06-04"))];
// [ 2021-06-01, 2021-06-02, 2021-06-03 ]
```

Your implementation of the `dateRangeGenerator` function looks great! It is a generator function that yields a sequence of dates from the `start` date to the `end` date, incrementing by a specified `step` (in days by default).

### How it works:

1. **Generator Function (`function*`)**: This function is a generator, which means it can yield values one at a time and maintain state across iterations. It uses the `yield` keyword to produce a value and pauses execution until the next value is requested.

2. **Date Logic**:

   - You initialize the date `d` to the `start` value.
   - Using `d.setDate(d.getDate() + step)`, you move the date forward by `step` days after each `yield`.
   - The loop continues as long as `d` is less than the `end` date.

3. **Spread Syntax (`[...]`)**: You use the spread syntax to convert the generator into an array, which collects all the yielded dates into a new array.

### Example Walkthrough:

```javascript
[...dateRangeGenerator(new Date("2021-06-01"), new Date("2021-06-04"))];
```

- **Start Date**: `2021-06-01`
- **End Date**: `2021-06-04`
- **Step**: Default step is `1` day.

The generator yields the following dates:

- `2021-06-01` (first date)
- `2021-06-02` (after 1 day)
- `2021-06-03` (after another day)

After `2021-06-03`, the next date would be `2021-06-04`, but since it is equal to the `end` date (`2021-06-04`), the generator stops, and the resulting array is:

```javascript
[2021 - 06 - 01, 2021 - 06 - 02, 2021 - 06 - 03];
```

### Some Example Variations:

#### 1. Custom Step Size:

If you want to generate dates with a step of 2 days:

```javascript
[...dateRangeGenerator(new Date("2021-06-01"), new Date("2021-06-10"), 2)];
```

This will give you:

```javascript
[
  2021 - 06 - 01,
  2021 - 06 - 03,
  2021 - 06 - 05,
  2021 - 06 - 07,
  2021 - 06 - 09,
];
```

#### 2. Reverse Date Range:

To generate dates in reverse order (from a later date to an earlier date), you can use a negative `step`:

```javascript
[...dateRangeGenerator(new Date("2021-06-10"), new Date("2021-06-01"), -1)];
```

This will give you:

```javascript
[
  2021 - 06 - 10,
  2021 - 06 - 09,
  2021 - 06 - 08,
  2021 - 06 - 07,
  2021 - 06 - 06,
  2021 - 06 - 05,
  2021 - 06 - 04,
  2021 - 06 - 03,
  2021 - 06 - 02,
];
```

#### 3. Edge Case (Single Date Range):

If the start date is the same as the end date, or the step size is `0`, the generator will not yield any dates:

```javascript
[...dateRangeGenerator(new Date("2021-06-01"), new Date("2021-06-01"))]; // []
[...dateRangeGenerator(new Date("2021-06-01"), new Date("2021-06-05"), 0)]; // []
```

### Summary:

Your `dateRangeGenerator` is a neat and efficient way to generate a sequence of dates over a range with a custom step size. The use of generator functions ensures that the date range is produced lazily, which can be very useful when working with large ranges or when you don't want to generate all the dates at once.

Feel free to ask if you'd like more advanced use cases or modifications!
