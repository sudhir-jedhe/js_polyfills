Your code defines several useful date comparison functions. Let's walk through each one, explaining the logic and ensuring everything is working as expected.

### 1. **`isSameDate` function**

The `isSameDate` function compares two dates to see if they represent the exact same moment in time, using the ISO 8601 format.

```javascript
const isSameDate = (dateA, dateB) =>
    dateA.toISOString() === dateB.toISOString();

isSameDate(new Date('2020-10-20'), new Date('2020-10-20')); // true
```

- This works because `toISOString()` converts a date to a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`, which includes both the date and time.
- When comparing `new Date('2020-10-20')` and `new Date('2020-10-20')`, the times are at `00:00:00.000Z`, so the comparison returns `true`.

### 2. **`isBeforeDate` function**

The `isBeforeDate` function checks if the first date is before the second date.

```javascript
const isBeforeDate = (dateA, dateB) => dateA < dateB;

isBeforeDate(new Date('2020-10-20'), new Date('2020-10-21')); // true
```

- The `<` operator compares two `Date` objects by their time value (milliseconds since the Unix epoch).
- Since `2020-10-20` is indeed before `2020-10-21`, the function returns `true`.

### 3. **`isAfterDate` function**

The `isAfterDate` function checks if the first date is after the second date.

```javascript
const isAfterDate = (dateA, dateB) => dateA > dateB;

isAfterDate(new Date('2020-10-21'), new Date('2020-10-20')); // true
```

- Similar to the `isBeforeDate` function, the `>` operator compares the two `Date` objects based on their time value (milliseconds).
- Since `2020-10-21` is after `2020-10-20`, the function returns `true`.

### 4. **`isBetweenDates` function**

The `isBetweenDates` function checks if a date is between two other dates (inclusive or exclusive depending on your requirements).

```javascript
const isBetweenDates = (startDate, endDate, targetDate) =>
    targetDate >= startDate && targetDate <= endDate;

isBetweenDates(new Date('2020-10-20'), new Date('2020-10-30'), new Date('2020-10-19')); // false
isBetweenDates(new Date('2020-10-20'), new Date('2020-10-30'), new Date('2020-10-25')); // true
```

- The function compares the `targetDate` to the `startDate` and `endDate` to see if it falls within the range.
- In the first case, `2020-10-19` is before `2020-10-20`, so the result is `false`.
- In the second case, `2020-10-25` is within the range of `2020-10-20` and `2020-10-30`, so the result is `true`.

### Potential Edge Cases

While the current logic works for most use cases, here are some potential edge cases to consider:

1. **Time Zones:** If the comparison involves dates in different time zones, it could lead to unexpected results. This can be addressed by converting the dates to the same time zone (e.g., UTC) before comparing.
2. **Inclusive vs. Exclusive Boundaries:** The `isBetweenDates` function is currently inclusive of both the `startDate` and `endDate`. If you want to make it exclusive (i.e., exclude the boundaries), you could adjust the comparisons to:
   ```javascript
   const isBetweenDates = (startDate, endDate, targetDate) =>
       targetDate > startDate && targetDate < endDate;
   ```

### Final Thoughts

- The logic for comparing dates is solid and covers basic date comparison use cases.
- You may want to consider adding some extra features like time zone handling if your application needs to compare dates from different regions.
