The functions `toTimestamp` and `fromTimestamp` you've written are working as expected, but let's break them down in detail to understand how they work and confirm their correctness.

### Function 1: `toTimestamp`

This function takes a `Date` object and returns the Unix timestamp (in seconds).

```javascript
const toTimestamp = date => Math.floor(date.getTime() / 1000);
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `date.getTime()` returns the time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
  - Dividing the result by `1000` converts the milliseconds into seconds.
  - `Math.floor()` ensures that we get an integer (the Unix timestamp should be an integer, and we want to round down any decimal).

- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  toTimestamp(new Date('2024-01-04'));
  ```

  Let's say the date provided is `2024-01-04` at midnight (`2024-01-04T00:00:00.000Z`). The Unix timestamp for that moment in UTC will be `1704326400`.

  - **Output**: `1704326400`

### Function 2: `fromTimestamp`

This function takes a Unix timestamp (in seconds) and converts it back to a `Date` object.

```javascript
const fromTimestamp = timestamp => new Date(timestamp * 1000);
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The timestamp passed to this function is in seconds, so we multiply it by `1000` to convert it back to milliseconds.
  - We then create a new `Date` object using this value.

- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  fromTimestamp(1704326400);
  ```

  This takes the Unix timestamp `1704326400` and converts it back to a `Date` object representing `2024-01-04T00:00:00.000Z`.

  - **Output**: `2024-01-04T00:00:00.000Z`

### Full Example:

```javascript
// Convert Date to Unix timestamp (seconds)
const toTimestamp = date => Math.floor(date.getTime() / 1000);

// Convert Unix timestamp (seconds) back to Date
const fromTimestamp = timestamp => new Date(timestamp * 1000);

// Example
console.log(toTimestamp(new Date('2024-01-04'))); // 1704326400
console.log(fromTimestamp(1704326400)); // 2024-01-04T00:00:00.000Z
```

### Output:

```
1704326400
2024-01-04T00:00:00.000Z
```

### Conclusion:

Your functions are correctly converting between `Date` objects and Unix timestamps:

- **`toTimestamp`**: Converts a `Date` to a Unix timestamp (in seconds).
- **`fromTimestamp`**: Converts a Unix timestamp (in seconds) back to a `Date`.

Both functions are efficient and working as intended!
