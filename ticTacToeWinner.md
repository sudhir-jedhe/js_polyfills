Your implementation of the `ticTacToeWinner` function looks great! This function checks for a winner, handles the draw scenario, and checks if the game is still pending. Here's a quick breakdown of how the function works and a few improvements you could make for clarity or optimization, though it's already quite good.

### Breakdown of the Function

1. **Check Rows**: The first `for` loop iterates through each row and checks if all three values in the row are the same and not `" "` (empty). If so, that player (either "X" or "O") is the winner.

2. **Check Columns**: The second part checks each column by comparing values at indices `[0][i]`, `[1][i]`, and `[2][i]`. If all three values are the same and not `" "`, then there is a winner in that column.

3. **Check Diagonals**: The next two conditions check the two diagonals:
   - From top-left to bottom-right (`board[0][0]`, `board[1][1]`, `board[2][2]`).
   - From top-right to bottom-left (`board[0][2]`, `board[1][1]`, `board[2][0]`).

4. **Check for Pending Game**: After checking for winners, the function checks if there are any empty spaces (`" "`) left on the board. If there are, the game is still ongoing, so it returns `"Pending"`.

5. **Check for Draw**: If there are no empty spaces and no winner, the game must have ended in a draw, so it returns `"Draw"`.

### Your Example Board

For your example board:

```javascript
const board = [
  ["X", "O", "X"],
  ["O", "X", "O"],
  ["X", "O", "X"],
];
```

- There are no rows, columns, or diagonals that have all the same values.
- All spaces are filled with no remaining `" "` (empty) spaces.
- Therefore, the function will return `"Draw"`, which is the expected outcome.

### A Slightly Optimized Version

While your implementation is already great, you could optimize a few things for clarity, such as:

- Combine checking the rows and columns in one loop, reducing repetition.
- Add an early exit condition to check for the winner as soon as a winner is found to avoid unnecessary checks.

Here is the optimized version:

```javascript
export function ticTacToeWinner(board) {
  // Check rows and columns in a single loop
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    // Check rows
    if (board[i][0] === board[i][1] && board[i][1] === board[i][2] && board[i][0] !== " ") {
      return board[i][0];
    }
    // Check columns
    if (board[0][i] === board[1][i] && board[1][i] === board[2][i] && board[0][i] !== " ") {
      return board[0][i];
    }
  }

  // Check diagonals
  if (board[0][0] === board[1][1] && board[1][1] === board[2][2] && board[0][0] !== " ") {
    return board[0][0];
  }
  if (board[0][2] === board[1][1] && board[1][1] === board[2][0] && board[0][2] !== " ") {
    return board[0][2];
  }

  // Check for draw or pending game
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      if (board[i][j] === " ") {
        return "Pending"; // Game still in progress
      }
    }
  }

  return "Draw"; // No winner, game is a draw
}
```

### Explanation of Optimizations

1. **Combined Loops for Rows and Columns**: Instead of having two separate `for` loops for rows and columns, I combined the check into one loop. This reduces the number of loop iterations by half and keeps the logic more compact.

2. **Early Exit on Winner Found**: Once a winner is detected, the function exits immediately and returns the winner. This prevents further unnecessary checks once a decision has been made.

### Usage Example

Now you can use this function in the following way:

```javascript
import { ticTacToeWinner } from './ticTacToeWinner.js';

const board = [
  ["X", "O", "X"],
  ["O", "X", "O"],
  ["X", "O", "X"],
];

console.log(ticTacToeWinner(board)); // Output: "Draw"
```

### Possible Outputs

- If there's a winner (e.g., `X` or `O`), it will return `"X"` or `"O"`.
- If the game is still ongoing (i.e., there are empty spaces), it will return `"Pending"`.
- If all spaces are filled and there's no winner, it will return `"Draw"`.

This solution should work efficiently and handle all possible scenarios for a Tic Tac Toe game.
