### **Problem Overview:**

The task is to find the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings that can be conducted in a single room, given the start and finish times of the meetings. There are two scenarios:

1. **Start and Finish Times in Separate Arrays**: Here, we will need to pair the start and finish times with their corresponding indices, sort the meetings by finish time, and then select the maximum possible meetings using a greedy approach.
2. **Start and Finish Times in a Nested Array**: In this case, the start and finish times are already paired in a 2D array, and we can directly use sorting and comparison to find the solution.

Let's explore both scenarios in detail.

### **Scenario 1: Start and Finish Times in Separate Arrays**

In this case, we are given two arrays: one for start times and one for finish times. We need to pair them, sort by the finish times, and use a greedy approach to select the maximum number of non-overlapping meetings.

**Greedy Approach**:
- Pair each meeting with its start time, finish time, and index.
- Sort the meetings by finish time.
- Select the first meeting (with the earliest finish time).
- For each subsequent meeting, select it if its start time is greater than the finish time of the previously selected meeting.

#### **Solution for Scenario 1**:

```javascript
// Create meeting pair object with start, finish, and index
const meetPair = (start, end, index) => ({
    start, end, index
});

const maxMeeting = (arr) => {
    // Sort the meeting array by finish time in ascending order
    arr.sort((a, b) => a.end - b.end);

    // To track the result, start with the first meeting
    const result = [];
    result.push(arr[0].index);
    
    // Track the finish time of the first selected meeting
    let timeLimit = arr[0].end;
    
    // Iterate through the remaining meetings
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        // If the current meeting's start time is greater than the last selected meeting's finish time
        if (arr[i].start > timeLimit) {
            result.push(arr[i].index);
            timeLimit = arr[i].end;
        }
    }
    
    return result; // Return the indices of the selected meetings
};

// Input data
const start = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5];
const finish = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9];

// Create a list of meetings with start, finish, and index
const meetings = [];
for (let i = 0; i < start.length; i++) {
    meetings.push(meetPair(start[i], finish[i], i));
}

// Call the function and print the result
const result = maxMeeting(meetings);
console.log(result); // Output: [0, 1, 3, 4]
console.log(result.length); // Output: 4
```

**Explanation**:
- We first pair each start time, finish time, and index.
- We sort the meetings based on their finish times using `arr.sort((a, b) => a.end - b.end)`.
- We select the first meeting (the one with the earliest finish time).
- For each subsequent meeting, we check if it can be scheduled (i.e., its start time is greater than the finish time of the last selected meeting).
- The final output will be the indices of the selected meetings, which are the ones that do not overlap.

### **Scenario 2: Start and Finish Times in a Nested Array**

In this case, the start and finish times are already given in a nested array, where each sub-array contains two elements: the start and finish time of a meeting. We can directly apply the same greedy approach.

#### **Solution for Scenario 2**:

```javascript
const maxMeeting = (arr) => {
    // Sort the meeting array by finish time in ascending order
    arr.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    // To track the result, start with the first meeting
    const result = [];
    result.push(arr[0]);
    
    // Track the finish time of the first selected meeting
    let timeLimit = arr[0][1];
    
    // Iterate through the remaining meetings
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        // If the current meeting's start time is greater than the last selected meeting's finish time
        if (arr[i][0] > timeLimit) {
            result.push(arr[i]);
            timeLimit = arr[i][1];
        }
    }
    
    return result; // Return the selected meetings
};

// Input data (2D array: [start, finish])
const meetings = [
    [1, 2], [3, 4], [0, 6], [5, 7], [8, 9], [5, 9]
];

// Call the function and print the result
const result = maxMeeting(meetings);
console.log(result); // Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 7], [8, 9]]
console.log(result.length); // Output: 4
```

**Explanation**:
- The meetings are represented as a 2D array where each sub-array has the start and finish times of the meeting.
- We sort the meetings by their finish time (`arr.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1])`).
- We select the first meeting and update the `timeLimit` to the finish time of that meeting.
- For each subsequent meeting, if its start time is greater than the `timeLimit`, we select it and update the `timeLimit`.
- The final output will be the list of selected meetings.

### **Conclusion**

- **Scenario 1** (with start and finish times in separate arrays) requires pairing the times and sorting by finish time. We then select meetings that don't overlap using a greedy algorithm.
- **Scenario 2** (with start and finish times in a nested array) is simpler as we directly work with the 2D array, sorting by finish time and applying the same greedy approach.

Both solutions effectively maximize the number of meetings that can be conducted in a single room.
