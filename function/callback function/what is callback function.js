// A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
// Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

function callbackFunction(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function outerFunction(callback) {
  let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
  callback(name);
}

outerFunction(callbackFunction);

// Why do we need callbacks

// The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
// Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

function firstFunction() {
  // Simulate a code delay
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("First function called");
  }, 1000);
}
function secondFunction() {
  console.log("Second function called");
}
firstFunction();
secondFunction();

Output;
// Second function called
// First function called

// As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesnâ€™t execute until the other code finishes execution.

// What is a callback hell

// Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

async1(function () {
  async2(function () {
    async3(function () {
      async4(function () {
        console.log("dfdf");
      });
    });
  });
});

// What is callback in callback

// You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.

loadScript("/script1.js", function (script) {
  console.log("first script is loaded");

  loadScript("/script2.js", function (script) {
    console.log("second script is loaded");

    loadScript("/script3.js", function (script) {
      console.log("third script is loaded");
      // after all scripts are loaded
    });
  });
});
