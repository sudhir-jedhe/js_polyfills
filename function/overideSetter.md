Let's break down your code and understand the behavior in JavaScript, especially how getter and setter methods work in classes. I'll explain the flow of execution, the behavior of `getter` and `setter`, and what happens when you override the setter.

### Code Breakdown:

```javascript
class A {
  val = 1;
  get foo() {
    return this.val;
  }
}

class B {
  val = 2;
  set foo(val) {
    this.val = val;
  }
}

const a = new A();
const b = new B();

console.log(a.foo);  // Line 1
console.log(b.foo);  // Line 2

b.foo = 3;  // Line 3

console.log(b.val);  // Line 4
console.log(b.foo);  // Line 5
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

#### 1. **Creating instances of `A` and `B`**

- When you create an instance of `A` (`const a = new A();`), the `val` property in `A` is initialized to `1`. The getter `foo` retrieves this value.

- When you create an instance of `B` (`const b = new B();`), the `val` property in `B` is initialized to `2`. The setter `foo(val)` allows you to set the value of `val` using the `foo` property.

#### 2. **Logging `a.foo`**

```javascript
console.log(a.foo);
```

- `a.foo` invokes the getter method in class `A`. This returns the value of `this.val`, which is `1`.
- **Output: `1`**

#### 3. **Logging `b.foo`**

```javascript
console.log(b.foo);
```

- `b.foo` tries to get the value using the setter method in class `B`. However, there is no getter for `foo` in class `B`, so it defaults to `undefined` (since `foo` is a setter without a getter).
- **Output: `undefined`**

#### 4. **Setting `b.foo = 3`**

```javascript
b.foo = 3;
```

- The setter `foo(val)` in class `B` is invoked with `val = 3`.
- This sets the `val` property of `b` to `3`.
- **No output here** but internally, `b.val` is now set to `3`.

#### 5. **Logging `b.val`**

```javascript
console.log(b.val);
```

- After setting `b.foo = 3`, the `val` property of `b` is now `3`, so the output will be `3`.
- **Output: `3`**

#### 6. **Logging `b.foo` Again**

```javascript
console.log(b.foo);
```

- Since `B` only has a setter for `foo` but no getter, this will return `undefined` again.
- **Output: `undefined`**

### Key Points about `getter` and `setter` in JavaScript:

1. **Getter:**
   - A getter is used to retrieve the value of an object's property in a controlled way.
   - In the case of class `A`, `get foo()` allows you to access the `val` property using `a.foo`, and the getter returns the value of `val`.

2. **Setter:**
   - A setter is used to modify the value of an object's property.
   - In the case of class `B`, `set foo(val)` allows you to set `b.foo = val`, and the setter modifies the `val` property of the instance.

3. **Getter/Setter Confusion:**
   - When you access `b.foo`, it invokes the setter because there is no getter defined in class `B`.
   - Since there's no getter for `foo`, accessing `b.foo` will return `undefined`.

4. **Overriding Setter:**
   - In your code, the setter `foo(val)` in class `B` is not "overridden" per se (since you are defining it from scratch). It's just being invoked when you try to set `b.foo`.
   - If you had defined both `getter` and `setter` for `foo`, you could access and modify `b.foo` in a more controlled way, for example:

```javascript
class B {
  val = 2;
  get foo() {
    return this.val;
  }
  set foo(val) {
    this.val = val;
  }
}

const b = new B();
console.log(b.foo);  // getter: 2
b.foo = 3;           // setter: sets b.val to 3
console.log(b.foo);  // getter: 3
console.log(b.val);  // 3
```

### Summary of Outputs:

```javascript
console.log(a.foo);  // Output: 1
console.log(b.foo);  // Output: undefined
b.foo = 3;
console.log(b.val);  // Output: 3
console.log(b.foo);  // Output: undefined
```

- The getter works fine for `a`, but `b.foo` is `undefined` because class `B` only defines a setter and not a getter.
- After setting `b.foo = 3`, the `val` property of `b` is modified, but `foo` still remains a setter, so when you log `b.foo`, it returns `undefined` again.
