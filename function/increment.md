Let's break down the behavior of the code you've provided, step by step, and explain how it works, especially focusing on the use of `Symbol.toPrimitive`, `+` operator, and getter methods.

### Code Breakdown

#### `Increment` Function Constructor

```javascript
function Increment() {
  if (!(this instanceof Increment)) {
    return new Increment();
  }

  this.value = 0;
}

Increment.prototype[Symbol.toPrimitive] = function () {
  return ++this.value;
};
```

- The `Increment` function is a constructor function that initializes an object with a `value` of `0`.
- The check `if (!(this instanceof Increment))` ensures that if the `Increment` function is called without `new` (like `Increment()`), it will automatically return a new instance of `Increment`. This is a pattern that allows a constructor to behave like a function and return a new instance if not called with `new`.
  
- The `Symbol.toPrimitive` method is implemented on the `Increment` prototype. This method allows the object to specify how it should be converted to a primitive value. In this case, it increments the `value` by 1 each time it's accessed and returns the updated `value`. This is a custom implementation of how JavaScript should handle implicit type conversions (e.g., using `+` for numeric conversions).

#### `increment1` and `increment2`

```javascript
let increment1 = new Increment();
let increment2 = Increment();
```

- `increment1` is created using `new Increment()`, so itâ€™s an object.
- `increment2` is created by calling `Increment()` without `new`, but due to the check inside the `Increment` function, it automatically returns a new instance of `Increment`.

#### First Comparison

```javascript
console.log(increment1 == +increment2); // true
```

- Here, the `+` operator is used to convert `increment2` into a primitive value.
  - `increment2` is an object, and when the `+` operator is applied, JavaScript will try to convert it to a primitive using the `Symbol.toPrimitive` method. 
  - Inside `Symbol.toPrimitive`, the `value` is incremented from `0` to `1`, and it returns `1`.
- Now we have `increment1 == 1`. The `==` operator is comparing `increment1` with `1`.
  - `increment1` is an object, and when compared to a primitive value (like `1`), JavaScript will attempt to convert `increment1` to a primitive using its own `Symbol.toPrimitive` method.
  - In the case of `increment1`, calling `Symbol.toPrimitive` will increment its `value` from `0` to `1`, so it becomes `1`.
- Since both `increment1` and `increment2` now both have the value `1`, the comparison `increment1 == +increment2` results in `true`.

#### String Interpolation with `increment1`

```javascript
console.log(`val: ${increment1}`); // val: 1
console.log(`val: ${increment1}`); // val: 2
console.log(`val: ${increment1}`); // val: 3
```

- The string interpolation `${increment1}` triggers the conversion of `increment1` to a primitive value, which will invoke its `Symbol.toPrimitive` method.
  - On the first call, the `value` of `increment1` is `0`. After incrementing in `Symbol.toPrimitive`, it becomes `1`, so the string `val: 1` is logged.
  - On the second call, `increment1.value` is now `1`, so it is incremented to `2`, and `val: 2` is logged.
  - On the third call, `increment1.value` is `2`, so it is incremented to `3`, and `val: 3` is logged.

Thus, each time `increment1` is used in the template string, the `value` gets incremented.

### Counter Object

```javascript
const counter = {
  value: 0,
  get value() {
    return ++this.value;
  },
};

console.log(counter.value, counter.value, counter.value); // 1 2 3
```

- The `counter` object has a getter method for the `value` property. Every time `counter.value` is accessed, the getter is called, and it increments the `value` before returning it.
  - On the first access, `this.value` is `0`, so it's incremented to `1` and returned.
  - On the second access, `this.value` is now `1`, so it's incremented to `2` and returned.
  - On the third access, `this.value` is now `2`, so it's incremented to `3` and returned.

Thus, the output for `console.log(counter.value, counter.value, counter.value)` will be `1 2 3`.

### Final Output

```javascript
{
  "root": {
    "practice": {
      "files": [
        "index.html",
        "app.js"
      ],
      "build": {
        "files": [
          "b.jpg"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Concepts:

1. **`Symbol.toPrimitive`**: This allows an object to specify its behavior when JavaScript tries to convert it to a primitive value (e.g., for arithmetic operations or string concatenation).
2. **Type Conversion with `+`**: When an object is involved in an operation that requires a primitive value, JavaScript will automatically invoke the `Symbol.toPrimitive` method of the object.
3. **Getter Methods**: The getter method for the `value` property in the `counter` object ensures that the value is incremented each time it's accessed.

### Summary:

- The `Increment` object behaves in a way that increments its `value` each time it is used in an operation that requires a primitive, like `+` or string interpolation.
- The `counter` object uses a getter to increment its `value` each time it is accessed, which results in an incremented value being returned each time it's logged.
