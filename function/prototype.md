### Question 1: `console.log(f.prototype);`

In JavaScript, every function has a `prototype` property, but when you call a function using `new`, you create an instance and the `prototype` of the function is set as the `[[Prototype]]` (i.e., the `__proto__`) of the created instance.

Let's break it down:

```javascript
function F() {
  this.foo = "bar";
}

const f = new F();
console.log(f.prototype);
```

- When you create `f` using `new F()`, the instance `f` will inherit properties and methods from `F.prototype`.
- However, `f.prototype` does not exist. Instead, `F.prototype` exists, which is the prototype object that `f` inherits from.
- `console.log(f.prototype)` will output `undefined`, because `f` (the instance) does not have a `prototype` property. It’s the function `F` that has a `prototype` property.

**Answer: `undefined`**.

### Question 2: `Foo.prototype.bar = 1;` and `Foo.prototype = { bar: 3 };`

Let’s go step by step to understand what happens here:

```javascript
function Foo() {}

Foo.prototype.bar = 1;  // This sets `bar` property on the prototype of `Foo`.

const a = new Foo();    // `a` is an instance of `Foo`, its `[[Prototype]]` points to `Foo.prototype`.
console.log(a.bar);     // Outputs `1`, because `a` inherits `bar` from `Foo.prototype`.

Foo.prototype.bar = 2;  // Changing the `bar` property on `Foo.prototype`.
const b = new Foo();    // `b` is a new instance, it inherits from the modified `Foo.prototype`.
console.log(a.bar);     // Outputs `2`, because `a`'s prototype has been updated.
console.log(b.bar);     // Outputs `2`, because `b` inherits the modified `bar` from `Foo.prototype`.

Foo.prototype = { bar: 3 };  // Reassigning `Foo.prototype` to a new object.
const c = new Foo();         // `c` is a new instance, but it now inherits from the new `Foo.prototype`.
console.log(a.bar);          // Outputs `2`, because `a` still inherits from the old prototype.
console.log(b.bar);          // Outputs `2`, because `b` inherits from the old prototype too.
console.log(c.bar);          // Outputs `3`, because `c` inherits from the new `Foo.prototype`.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Step 1**: `Foo.prototype.bar = 1;` sets the `bar` property on `Foo.prototype`.
2. **Step 2**: `const a = new Foo();` creates an instance `a` of `Foo`. It gets the `bar` property from `Foo.prototype`, which was set to `1`. Therefore, `console.log(a.bar)` outputs `1`.
3. **Step 3**: `Foo.prototype.bar = 2;` changes the `bar` property on `Foo.prototype` to `2`.
   - The change affects all instances created after this change, so `b.bar` will be `2`, but it also affects `a.bar` because `a` still points to the old `Foo.prototype` (now updated).
4. **Step 4**: `Foo.prototype = { bar: 3 };` changes `Foo.prototype` entirely to a new object, with `bar` set to `3`.
   - This affects only instances created *after* this point. So, `c.bar` will be `3`, but `a.bar` and `b.bar` will not be affected because they still inherit from the old prototype (which has `bar: 2`).

**Summary of Output**:
- `console.log(a.bar)` will output `2`, because `a` inherits from the updated `Foo.prototype`.
- `console.log(b.bar)` will output `2`, because `b` inherits from the updated `Foo.prototype`.
- `console.log(c.bar)` will output `3`, because `c` inherits from the newly reassigned `Foo.prototype`.

### Final Output:
```javascript
1  // console.log(a.bar)
2  // console.log(a.bar)
2  // console.log(b.bar)
3  // console.log(c.bar)
```
