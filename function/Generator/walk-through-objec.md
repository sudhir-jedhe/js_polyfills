// Given an object with deeply nested keys, walking through its leaf nodes is a non-trivial task. Supposing that we want to visit each key in a depth-first manner, we can code a generator function to achieve this, by recursively visiting each key and its children.

// To walk through a JavaScript object depth-first, you need to use a for...of loop and Object.keys() to iterate over the keys of the object. You can then use typeof to check if each value in the given object is itself an object.

// If so, you can use the yield* expression to recursively delegate to the same generator function, appending the current key to the array of keys. Otherwise, you can yield an array of keys representing the current path and the value of the given key.
Here is the complete implementation of the `walkThrough` generator function along with an example that processes the nested object and outputs the result:

```javascript
const walkThrough = function* (obj) {
    const walk = function* (x, previous = []) {
        for (let key of Object.keys(x)) {
            if (typeof x[key] === 'object' && x[key] !== null) {
                // Recursively handle nested objects or arrays
                yield* walk(x[key], [...previous, key]);
            } else {
                // Yield the path and value
                yield [[...previous, key], x[key]];
            }
        }
    };
    yield* walk(obj);
};

// Example object
const obj = {
    a: 10,
    b: 20,
    c: {
        d: 10,
        e: 20,
        f: [30, 40]
    },
    g: [
        {
            h: 10,
            i: 20
        },
        {
            j: 30
        },
        40
    ]
};

// Collect all key-value pairs as an array
const result = [...walkThrough(obj)];
console.log(result);

/*
Output:
[
  [['a'], 10],
  [['b'], 20],
  [['c', 'd'], 10],
  [['c', 'e'], 20],
  [['c', 'f', '0'], 30],
  [['c', 'f', '1'], 40],
  [['g', '0', 'h'], 10],
  [['g', '0', 'i'], 20],
  [['g', '1', 'j'], 30],
  [['g', '2'], 40]
]
*/
```

### Key Features:
1. **Null Check:**
   - Ensures values like `null` are not treated as objects by adding `x[key] !== null` to the condition.

2. **Path Tracking:**
   - Uses the `previous` array to track the current path during recursion.

3. **Generator Expansion:**
   - The generator results are collected into an array using the spread operator (`[...]`).

4. **Generic Handling:**
   - Works with both objects and arrays.

### How It Works:
- The generator iteratively traverses the nested structure.
- For each value:
  - If itâ€™s an object or array, it recurses deeper.
  - Otherwise, it yields the path and value.
- The paths are arrays of keys that represent the location of each value in the original object.
