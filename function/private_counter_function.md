Your `privateCounter` function is very close to being correct, but there is a small syntax error in the object you're returning. Specifically, you're missing a comma between the two methods (`increment` and `retrieve`).

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```javascript
function privateCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment: function (val = 1) {
      count += val;
    },
    retrieve: function () {
      return count;
    }
  };
}

// driver code
const counter = privateCounter();
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.retrieve()); // 2
counter.increment(5);
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.retrieve()); // 8
```

### Explanation:
- **`count`** is declared as a local variable inside the `privateCounter` function, so it is **private** and can't be accessed directly from outside.
- The **`increment`** method allows you to increase the value of `count` by a specified amount (defaulting to `1`).
- The **`retrieve`** method allows you to get the current value of `count`.

### Output:
```javascript
2
8
```

This implementation successfully encapsulates the `count` variable and provides two functionalities:
- **Incrementing** the count by a specified value.
- **Retrieving** the current count value.
