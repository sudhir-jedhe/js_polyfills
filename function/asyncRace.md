To implement the `race()` function, we need to create a helper that behaves like `Promise.race()`. The key characteristic of `Promise.race()` is that it resolves or rejects as soon as the first promise (or async function in this case) resolves or rejects. 

### Requirements:
1. **First to Finish**: `race()` should return a result (either data or error) from the first async function that completes.
2. **Error Handling**: If any function results in an error, the `race()` should immediately return that error and ignore subsequent results (whether they are successful or failed).
3. **Return a new function**: The function returned by `race()` should accept a callback (`callback`), which will be invoked when any async function completes (either with an error or success).

### Solution Approach:
- We'll iterate over the functions in the `funcs` array.
- We'll execute each function, and in the callback of each function:
  - If the function completes without an error, immediately invoke the `callback` with the result.
  - If any function encounters an error, we immediately invoke the `callback` with the error.
- Once the `callback` is called (either due to a result or an error), we ensure that no further calls are made by setting a `completed` flag.

### Final Implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {AsyncFunc[]} funcs - Array of asynchronous functions
 * @return {(callback: Callback) => void} - Returns a function that takes a final callback
 */
function race(funcs) {
  let completed = false;

  return function (callback) {
    funcs.forEach((func) => {
      func((error, value) => {
        // If the race is already complete (either by success or error), do nothing
        if (completed) return;

        if (error) {
          // If any function results in an error, return that error immediately
          callback(error, undefined);
          completed = true; // Mark as completed to prevent further calls
          return;
        }

        // If the function completes successfully, return its result
        callback(undefined, value);
        completed = true; // Mark as completed to prevent further calls
      });
    });
  };
}

// Example async functions with different delays
const async1 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 1), 300);
};

const async2 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 2), 100);
};

const async3 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 3), 200);
};

// Example usage of race function
const first = race([async1, async2, async3]);

first((error, data) => {
  console.log(data); // 2, since 2 is the first to be given
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **`completed` flag**: This ensures that once the first function finishes (either with a result or error), we prevent the `callback` from being called again.
2. **`forEach` loop**: We iterate over each function in the `funcs` array and call them. If any function finishes (either successfully or with an error), we immediately call the `callback` with the result or error, and mark the race as completed.
3. **Error Handling**: If any function triggers an error, we immediately invoke the callback with that error and stop further execution of any remaining async functions.

### Example Output:
Given the example async functions:
```javascript
const async1 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 1), 300);
};

const async2 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 2), 100);
};

const async3 = (callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => callback(undefined, 3), 200);
};
```

The `race()` function will return the first result to complete. Since `async2` completes in 100ms, the output will be:

```
2
```

If an error occurs in any function (for example, `async2` encounters an error), the callback will immediately be invoked with that error, and no further results will be processed.

### Edge Cases:
1. **All functions succeed**: The first one to complete should return its result.
2. **Error Handling**: If any function encounters an error, it should immediately return that error, and other functions' results (whether successful or not) should be ignored.
3. **Empty Function Array**: If the `funcs` array is empty, no function will be executed. Itâ€™s up to the user to decide what behavior they expect in this case, but typically, we'd assume at least one function should be passed.

### Conclusion:
This implementation of `race()` efficiently handles concurrent asynchronous tasks, making it behave similarly to `Promise.race()`. It ensures that the result from the first completed function is returned, and if any function encounters an error, it immediately halts further execution and returns that error.
