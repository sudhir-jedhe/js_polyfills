Let's break down both functions you've shared — `getCircularReplacer` and `removeCycle` — as well as their expected behavior, and ensure that they handle circular references properly.

### 1. **`getCircularReplacer`**:
This function is designed to be used with `JSON.stringify` to avoid errors when trying to serialize objects that have circular references. Circular references happen when an object references itself directly or indirectly.

#### What does it do?
- It uses a `WeakSet` to track objects that have already been encountered during the serialization process.
- If an object is encountered that has already been added to the `WeakSet`, the function skips it to prevent an infinite loop.
- Otherwise, it adds the object to the `WeakSet` and proceeds with serialization.

### Code:

```javascript
const getCircularReplacer = () => {
  // A WeakSet to track objects that have been seen
  const seen = new WeakSet();

  // Return the replacer function used by JSON.stringify
  return (key, value) => {
    // If value is an object and it's not null
    if (typeof value === "object" && value !== null) {
      // If we've already seen this object, return undefined (skip serialization)
      if (seen.has(value)) {
        return;
      }
      // Otherwise, add it to the WeakSet
      seen.add(value);
    }
    return value;
  };
};

// Example usage:
const item1 = { val: 10 };
const item2 = { val: 20 };
const item3 = { val: 30 };

item1.next = item2;
item2.next = item3;
item3.next = item1; // Circular reference

console.log(JSON.stringify(item1, getCircularReplacer())); 
// Output: {"val":10,"next":{"val":20,"next":{"val":30}}}
```

#### Explanation:
- **WeakSet**: This data structure ensures that we don't keep strong references to objects, which helps with memory management. It allows us to track object references without preventing garbage collection.
- **Circular Detection**: The `replacer` function checks whether an object has been seen before. If so, it returns `undefined`, effectively omitting that property from serialization (thus avoiding infinite recursion).
  
#### Output:
```json
{
  "val": 10,
  "next": {
    "val": 20,
    "next": {
      "val": 30
    }
  }
}
```

The circular reference is effectively handled, and we don't end up with an infinite loop or an error during `JSON.stringify()`.

### 2. **`removeCycle`**:
This function is designed to remove circular references from an object, effectively "breaking" the cycle and preventing infinite loops during operations like serialization.

#### What does it do?
- It uses a `WeakSet` to track objects encountered during the traversal.
- If a reference to an object is encountered again (which indicates a circular reference), it removes that reference by using `delete`.
- The function works recursively by traversing through the object's properties and their nested objects.

### Code:

```javascript
const removeCycle = (obj) => {
  // A WeakSet to keep track of objects we've already visited
  const set = new WeakSet([obj]);

  // Helper function to iterate over the object and remove cycles
  (function iterateObj(obj) {
    for (let key in obj) {
      // If the object has the property directly (not from its prototype chain)
      if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        if (typeof obj[key] === 'object' && obj[key] !== null) {
          // If we've seen this object reference before, delete the key
          if (set.has(obj[key])) { 
            delete obj[key];
          } else {
            // Otherwise, add the object to the WeakSet
            set.add(obj[key]);
            // Recursively check the next object
            iterateObj(obj[key]);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })(obj);
};

// Example usage:
const List = function(val) {
  this.next = null;
  this.val = val;
};

const item1 = new List(10);
const item2 = new List(20);
const item3 = new List(30);

item1.next = item2;
item2.next = item3;
item3.next = item1; // Circular reference

removeCycle(item1); // Remove the cycle
console.log(item1);
```

#### Explanation:
- **WeakSet**: Similar to the previous function, we use `WeakSet` to track objects we've visited. This prevents revisiting objects and ensures that circular references are identified.
- **Recursive Iteration**: We recursively traverse all properties of the object and check if any object references have already been encountered. If a circular reference is detected (i.e., we've seen this object before), we delete the corresponding property.

#### Output:
```json
{
  "val": 10,
  "next": {
    "val": 20,
    "next": {
      "val": 30
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, the cycle between `item3` and `item1` is removed, and no circular reference is left in the final structure.

---

### Conclusion:
1. **`getCircularReplacer`** is used to serialize objects with circular references into a JSON string, omitting the circular references to prevent infinite loops during serialization.
2. **`removeCycle`** removes circular references from an object by deleting the properties that create the cycle, breaking the loop and ensuring the object can be safely serialized or otherwise manipulated.

Both of these functions are useful when working with complex data structures that may have cyclic relationships, and they handle circular references gracefully without causing memory or recursion issues.
