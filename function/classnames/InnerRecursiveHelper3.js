// In this approach, an inner classNamesImpl helper function is defined and
// it accepts a classesArr argument. The classesArr is modified and passed
//  along within recursive calls and all classNamesImpl calls reference
//  the same instance of classesArr. The helper function does not return anything,
// it's main purpose is to process each argument and add them to the classesArr argument.

// Approach 3: Inner recursive helper that modifies the argument
