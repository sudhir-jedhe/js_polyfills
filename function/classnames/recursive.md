Both versions of the `classNames` function you provided are effectively similar, with one being written in plain JavaScript and the other in TypeScript. Below is a breakdown of the implementation:

### Key Features:

1. **Handling Different Types of Arguments**:
   - **Strings and Numbers**: If the argument is a string or a number, it is directly added to the `classes` array.
   - **Arrays**: If the argument is an array, the `classNames` function is called recursively to process the elements within the array, and the results are added to the `classes` array.
   - **Objects**: If the argument is an object, the function loops through the keys of the object. If the key has a truthy value, the key (class name) is added to the `classes` array.

2. **Falsy Values**: Any falsy values (such as `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, or an empty string) are ignored.

3. **Recursion for Nested Arrays**: If the argument is an array, `classNames` is called recursively to handle nested arrays. This ensures that arrays are flattened and all class names are included in the result.

4. **TypeScript Types**: The TypeScript version uses `ClassValue`, `ClassDictionary`, and `ClassArray` types to ensure that arguments can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, or `null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, etc. This provides stronger type safety.

5. **Type Checking**:
   - In both versions, the type of each argument is checked using `typeof`.
   - `Object.hasOwn(obj, key)` ensures that only the object's own properties (not inherited properties) are processed.

### Example Walkthrough:

```typescript
classNames('foo', { bar: true }, ['baz', { qux: true }]);
```

- **'foo'** is a string, so it's added directly to the `classes` array.
- **{ bar: true }** is an object with a truthy value, so `'bar'` is added to the `classes` array.
- **['baz', { qux: true }]** is an array:
  - `'baz'` is a string, so it is added.
  - `{ qux: true }` is an object with a truthy value, so `'qux'` is added.

Final result:
```typescript
'foo bar baz qux'
```

### Example Outputs:

```javascript
console.log(classNames('foo', 'bar')); // 'foo bar'
console.log(classNames('foo', { bar: true })); // 'foo bar'
console.log(classNames({ 'foo-bar': true })); // 'foo-bar'
console.log(classNames({ 'foo-bar': false })); // ''
console.log(classNames({ foo: true }, { bar: true })); // 'foo bar'
console.log(classNames('a', ['b', { c: true, d: false }])); // 'a b c'
console.log(classNames('foo', { bar: true, duck: false }, 'baz', { quux: true })); // 'foo bar baz quux'
console.log(classNames(null, false, 'bar', undefined, { baz: null }, '')); // 'bar'
```

### Breakdown of Code Flow:

1. **Falsy Values Check**: `if (!arg)` ensures that any falsy values are ignored.
2. **String/Number Handling**: If the argument is a string or a number, it is added to the `classes` array by calling `classes.push(arg)`.
3. **Array Handling**: If the argument is an array, `classNames(...arg)` is called recursively, and the result is added to the `classes` array.
4. **Object Handling**: If the argument is an object, the function loops through the keys of the object, adding keys that have truthy values to the `classes` array.
5. **Join and Return**: Finally, `classes.join(' ')` concatenates the class names into a single string with spaces separating them.

### Final Thoughts:

- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that even nested arrays are flattened and processed correctly.
- **Type Safety (TypeScript)**: The TypeScript version enforces better type safety, helping to prevent runtime errors by ensuring the types of the arguments are correctly handled.
- **Flexibility**: It can handle mixed inputs, including strings, objects, arrays, and numbers, making it very flexible for use in a wide variety of scenarios.

This is a clean and efficient way to conditionally join class names in JavaScript and TypeScript, especially when dealing with dynamic class names based on conditions.
