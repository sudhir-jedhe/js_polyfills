The code you provided generates the current date in the format `MM/DD/YYYY`, where:

1. `today.getDate()` gets the day of the month.
2. `today.getMonth()` gets the month (note that JavaScript months are 0-indexed, meaning January is 0).
3. `today.getFullYear()` gets the year.

The `String(...).padStart(2, "0")` method ensures that both the day and the month are always two digits, padding with `0` if necessary (e.g., "01" for the 1st day or month).

Here is how the code works:

```javascript
var today = new Date(); // Get the current date
var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0"); // Get day and pad to 2 digits
var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); // Get month (0-based index) and pad
var yyyy = today.getFullYear(); // Get the full year

today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy; // Format the date as MM/DD/YYYY
document.write(today); // Output the formatted date
```

### Example Output:
If today's date is January 3, 2025, the output will be:

```
01/03/2025
```

This ensures that the date is displayed in the `MM/DD/YYYY` format with two-digit month and day values.
