In JavaScript, when you compare dates, it's important to understand the difference between comparing **primitive values** (like numbers or strings) and **objects** (like `Date` objects).

Let's break it down:

### 1. **Comparing Dates with `getTime()`**:
```javascript
var d1 = new Date();
var d2 = new Date(d1);

console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); // true
```
- `d1.getTime()` and `d2.getTime()` return the **numeric timestamp** (milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) for the given dates.
- Since `d1` and `d2` were created with the same date value, their timestamps will be equal, hence the comparison using `getTime()` will return `true`.

### 2. **Comparing Date Objects Directly (`===`)**:
```javascript
console.log(d1 === d2); // false
```
- `d1` and `d2` are **two separate instances of `Date` objects**. Even though they represent the same point in time, they are distinct objects in memory.
- In JavaScript, comparing objects with the `===` operator checks if they are **the same object reference**, not if their internal values are equal.
- Since `d1` and `d2` point to different objects in memory, the comparison `d1 === d2` returns `false`.

### Conclusion:
- **`.getTime()`**: Use this method to compare the **numeric value** (timestamp) of two dates. This checks if the dates represent the same exact point in time.
- **`===`**: Use this operator to compare whether two variables reference the **same object** (i.e., have the same memory reference). In the case of `Date` objects, this will return `false` if they are not the same object.

### Example Summary:
```javascript
var d1 = new Date();
var d2 = new Date(d1);

console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); // true (same point in time)
console.log(d1 === d2); // false (different objects)
```
