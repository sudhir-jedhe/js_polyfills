```js

function myInterval(func, delay) {
  const intervalId = setInterval(func, delay);
  return function cancel() {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  };
}

const cancelInterval = myInterval(function () {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}, 1000);

// Cancel the interval after 5 seconds.
setTimeout(cancelInterval, 5000);
```

Your implementation of `myInterval` is correct and works as expected! It sets up a function (`func`) to be executed repeatedly at a specified `delay`, and it returns a function (`cancel`) that can be used to cancel the interval.

### **Explanation of the Code:**

1. **`myInterval` Function**:
   - The `myInterval` function takes two arguments:
     - `func`: The function that should be called repeatedly.
     - `delay`: The time (in milliseconds) between successive calls of `func`.
   - `setInterval(func, delay)` is used to repeatedly execute `func` at the specified `delay`.
   - `setInterval` returns an `intervalId`, which is used to stop the interval when needed.

2. **Returning a cancel function**:
   - The `cancel` function, when called, will stop the interval by using `clearInterval(intervalId)`.

3. **Usage Example**:
   - You create an interval that logs `"Hello, world!"` to the console every second (`1000` ms).
   - After 5 seconds (`5000` ms), `setTimeout(cancelInterval, 5000)` is called to stop the interval by invoking the `cancelInterval` function.

### **Behavior of the Example:**

- `myInterval` starts the logging function every 1 second.
- After 5 seconds, the interval is canceled, and no further log statements are printed.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown of Example Execution:**

1. **`myInterval` is called**:
   - The `setInterval` is set up, and the `intervalId` is returned.
   - The `cancel` function is returned by `myInterval` so you can later use it to clear the interval.

2. **After 1 second**:
   - `"Hello, world!"` is logged to the console.

3. **After 2 seconds**:
   - `"Hello, world!"` is logged again to the console.

4. **After 5 seconds**:
   - `setTimeout(cancelInterval, 5000)` is called, and the `cancel` function is invoked.
   - The `clearInterval(intervalId)` stops the repeated execution of `func`.

5. **After 5 seconds and beyond**:
   - No further logs are printed because the interval was cleared.

### **Summary:**

Your code correctly implements a custom `myInterval` function with cancellation. The logic is solid, and the use of `setInterval`/`clearInterval` is appropriate for this task.

Great job!
