The task you've outlined involves creating a JavaScript function that can handle **cumulative summation** through repeated calls, allowing for continuous addition until no argument is passed. This is often achieved with the use of **closures** in JavaScript, which allow inner functions to remember their outer function's state.

I'll explain how each of the solutions works, and I'll also highlight some ways to optimize or enhance the implementation.

### **Solution 1: Using Recursion with `valueOf` Override**

```javascript
function sum(num) {
  const func = function(num2) {
    // If a second number is passed, recursively call sum with the new total.
    return num2 !== undefined ? sum(num + num2) : num;
  };

  func.valueOf = () => num; // Override the valueOf method to return the current sum.
  return func;
}

// Usage:
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3) == 6); // true
console.log(sum(5)(-1)(2) == 6); // true
console.log(sum(1)(2) == 3); // true
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The `sum` function returns a function `func` that keeps adding numbers until `undefined` is passed (via the absence of an argument).
  - **Recursion** is used to continue the summing process: each time a number is passed, it adds to the accumulated sum and calls itself recursively.
  - The `valueOf` method is overridden to return the current sum when the function is coerced into a primitive value (i.e., when compared with a number). This makes it possible to use the sum function in expressions like `sum(1)(2)(3) == 6`.
  - This solution provides a way to repeatedly call `sum`, and the recursion stops once no arguments are passed.

### **Solution 2: Using Symbol.toPrimitive (Alternative to `valueOf`)**

```javascript
function sum(num) {
  const fn = (b) => sum(num + b);
  fn[Symbol.toPrimitive] = () => num;
  return fn;
}

// Usage:
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3) == 6); // true
console.log(sum(5)(-1)(2) == 6); // true
console.log(sum(1)(2) == 3); // true
```

- **Explanation**:
  - This version uses `Symbol.toPrimitive` to control how the object (in this case, the function) is converted to a primitive value.
  - Instead of overriding `valueOf`, we override the `Symbol.toPrimitive` method. This method is called whenever JavaScript needs to convert the object to a primitive type, for example, when it needs to compare the value or use it in a numerical expression.
  - The logic inside `Symbol.toPrimitive` is similar to `valueOf`, but it allows more control over different types of coercions (e.g., string vs number).

### **Solution 3: With `undefined` Handling for Edge Cases**

```javascript
function sum(num) {
  const func = function(num2) {
    return num2 !== undefined ? sum(num + num2) : num; // Handle the case when no number is passed.
  };

  func.valueOf = () => num;
  return func;
}

// Usage:
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3) == 6); // true
console.log(sum(1)(0)(3) == 4); // true (now handles zero correctly)
```

- **Explanation**:
  - This is a slightly modified version of the first solution, where we explicitly check if `num2` is `undefined`. This prevents issues when `sum(1)(0)(3)` is called, as it would ensure that `0` is treated as a valid number rather than stopping the recursion prematurely.
  - This fix ensures that calling `sum(1)(0)(3)` returns `4`, not `1`.

### **Solution 4: A Simple Version Using `valueOf`**

```javascript
function sum(num) {
  const func = function(num2) {
    return num2 ? sum(num + num2) : num;
  };
  func.valueOf = () => num;
  return func;
}

// Usage:
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3) == 6); // true
console.log(sum(5)(-1)(2) == 6); // true
```

- **Explanation**:
  - This is a simplified version that just uses recursion with `valueOf` to handle the summing process. It continues adding numbers recursively until no argument is passed (i.e., `num2` is falsy).
  - The `valueOf` is still used to return the sum when the function is evaluated.

### **How to Optimize the Code:**

- **Performance Consideration**: While these methods are great for demonstrating closures and recursion, the performance of recursive function calls in JavaScript can degrade with very large numbers of additions due to the risk of exceeding the call stack. Using a simple loop-based approach or using an accumulator function might be more efficient for cases requiring large numbers of additions.
  
- **Improvement for Readability and Edge Cases**: The `Symbol.toPrimitive` approach (Solution 2) is a cleaner and more modern way of overriding object-to-primitive coercion, making the code more future-proof and readable compared to using `valueOf`. Also, it's less prone to unexpected behavior.

### **Final Thoughts:**
- **Key Concepts Used**: Closures, recursion, `valueOf` and `Symbol.toPrimitive` methods, function chaining.
- **Usage**: This function allows for flexible chaining of function calls with continuous addition, and it also handles cases where no number is passed by returning the sum.
