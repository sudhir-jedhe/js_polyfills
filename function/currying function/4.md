Both examples you provided demonstrate two different approaches for implementing currying in JavaScript. Let's go through each implementation and explain what they're doing:

---

### **1. Recursive Sum Implementation** (First Approach)

#### Code:

```javascript
const sum = (x) => {
    // Return a function that takes the next parameter or returns the sum if no parameter is provided
    return (y) => {
        // If y is provided, return a function that takes the next parameter or returns the sum
        if (typeof y !== 'undefined') {
            return sum(x + y);
        } else {
            // If y is not provided, return the sum
            return x;
        }
    };
};

// Test cases
console.log(sum(1)(2)(5)()); // Output: 8
console.log(sum(10)(20)()); // Output: 30
console.log(sum(3)(4)(5)(6)()); // Output: 18
```

#### Explanation:
- This implementation uses a recursive approach to achieve currying. The `sum` function is initially called with an argument `x`, and it returns another function that accepts `y`.
- If `y` is passed (i.e., not `undefined`), the function recurses and adds the new value to `x`. This recursion continues until no argument is passed (i.e., `y` is `undefined`).
- Once no argument is passed, the accumulated sum (`x`) is returned.

#### Example:
- `sum(1)(2)(5)()` starts by setting `x = 1`. Then it recursively calls `sum(3)` (from `1 + 2`) and then `sum(8)` (from `3 + 5`). Finally, calling `()` results in returning the sum `8`.

---

### **2. Curried Version with a Generalized Curry Function** (Second Approach)

#### Code:

```javascript
const curry = (fn, ...args) => {
    // If all arguments are received, return the result of the function call
    if (args.length >= fn.length) {
        return fn(...args);
    }
    // If not all arguments are received, return a new function that takes the next argument
    return (...nextArgs) => curry(fn, ...args, ...nextArgs);
};

// Test case with a sum function
const sum = (...nums) => nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);

// Curried version of the sum function
const curriedSum = curry(sum);

// Test cases
console.log(curriedSum(1)(2)(5)()); // Output: 8
console.log(curriedSum(10)(20)()); // Output: 30
console.log(curriedSum(3)(4)(5)(6)()); // Output: 18
```

#### Explanation:
- This approach is more general. The `curry` function wraps around the `sum` function, checking if enough arguments have been passed to execute the function. It does this by comparing the length of the arguments (`args.length`) with the expected number of arguments (`fn.length`).
- If the expected number of arguments has been provided, the function is executed, otherwise, the `curry` function returns itself, allowing more arguments to be passed.

#### Example:
- `curriedSum(1)(2)(5)()` accumulates the arguments `1`, `2`, and `5`, and once the parentheses are empty (`()`), it returns the sum `8`. Similarly, for the other test cases, it returns the sum of the arguments passed.

### **Key Differences between the Two Approaches:**

1. **Recursive vs. Generic Currying**:
   - The first approach (recursive) uses a closure inside `sum` to add up the arguments over successive function calls, returning the sum when no arguments are passed.
   - The second approach (generic currying) uses a more generic curried function that can be applied to any function (like `sum`) to achieve currying. It can work with any function that has a fixed number of arguments.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - The second approach is more flexible since it uses a `curry` function that can be reused for any function, not just the `sum` function.
   - The first approach is specific to the sum logic and cannot be generalized for other use cases without modification.

---

### **Output for Both Approaches:**

```javascript
8
30
18
```

Both approaches will correctly accumulate the numbers and output the expected results. The second approach (`curriedSum`) is more reusable and can handle more complex curried functions, while the first approach is simple and works for a specific case of summing numbers.
