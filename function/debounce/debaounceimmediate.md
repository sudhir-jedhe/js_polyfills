This implementation of `debounce` with an optional `immediate` parameter is a great way to control the frequency of function execution in scenarios like event handling. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

---

### Key Concepts:
1. **Timer Storage**:
   - A private variable `timeout` is used to keep track of the timer ID, ensuring proper control over function calls.

2. **Context and Arguments**:
   - The `context` and `args` of the function are stored so that they can be passed correctly when the debounced function is executed.

3. **Immediate Execution**:
   - The `immediate` parameter determines if the function should be executed immediately on the leading edge (when the timer starts) or after the delay (trailing edge).

4. **Reset Mechanism**:
   - `clearTimeout(timeout)` ensures that every invocation of the debounced function resets the timer, effectively delaying execution until the events stop firing.

### Detailed Implementation:

#### `debounce` Function

```javascript
const debounce = (func, wait, immediate) => {
  let timeout;

  return function (...args) {
    const context = this;

    const callNow = immediate && !timeout;

    clearTimeout(timeout);

    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      timeout = null;
      if (!immediate) {
        func.apply(context, args);
      }
    }, wait);

    if (callNow) {
      func.apply(context, args);
    }
  };
};
```

### Usage Example:

#### Scenario: Logging Mouse Coordinates on Move

```javascript
function onMouseMove(e) {
  console.clear();
  console.log(`Mouse Coordinates: (${e.x}, ${e.y})`);
}

// Define the debounced function with immediate execution
const debouncedMouseMove = debounce(onMouseMove, 50, true);

// Attach the debounced function to the `mousemove` event
window.addEventListener('mousemove', debouncedMouseMove);
```

---

### How It Works:

1. **Immediate Execution (`immediate = true`)**:
   - The function executes immediately the first time the event fires.
   - Subsequent invocations during the wait period do not trigger the function until the timer expires.

2. **Trailing Execution (`immediate = false`)**:
   - The function only executes after the user stops triggering the event for the specified delay.

---

### Example with Immediate and Trailing Execution:

```javascript
// Example callback function
function logMessage() {
  console.log('Debounced function executed');
}

// Debounced with immediate execution
const debouncedImmediate = debounce(logMessage, 2000, true);

// Debounced with trailing execution
const debouncedTrailing = debounce(logMessage, 2000, false);

// Trigger the debounced functions
debouncedImmediate(); // Executes immediately
debouncedTrailing(); // Executes after 2 seconds
```

This versatile `debounce` function is highly reusable for scenarios such as:
- **Input Field Validation**: Debounce API calls while the user is typing.
- **Scroll Events**: Limit the frequency of scroll-based animations or calculations.
- **Mouse Movement**: Reduce the frequency of event handlers for mouse movements.
