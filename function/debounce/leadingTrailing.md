Debouncing is a useful technique, especially in scenarios where rapid, repetitive actions trigger costly function calls or events (e.g., handling keystrokes in a search box, resizing a window, scrolling, etc.). The goal of debouncing is to limit the frequency of function execution by waiting until the action has stopped for a specific duration.

For this case, we can create a **debounce function with leading and trailing options**.

### Debounce with Leading and Trailing Options
We will create a `debounce` function that accepts:

- `func`: The function to debounce.
- `wait`: The debounce delay in milliseconds.
- `leading`: A boolean flag indicating whether to invoke the function immediately at the beginning of the delay period.
- `trailing`: A boolean flag indicating whether to invoke the function at the end of the delay period.

Here’s the implementation of the debounced function:

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait, leading = false, trailing = true) {
  let timeout;
  let lastArgs;
  let lastContext;
  let lastInvokeTime = 0;

  const invokeFunc = () => {
    const timeSinceLastCall = Date.now() - lastInvokeTime;
    if (timeSinceLastCall >= wait || timeSinceLastCall < 0) {
      // Invoke the function
      func.apply(lastContext, lastArgs);
      lastInvokeTime = Date.now();
    }
  };

  const debounced = function (...args) {
    lastArgs = args;
    lastContext = this;

    // Determine if we should call the function immediately (leading)
    if (leading && !timeout) {
      invokeFunc();
    }

    // Clear the timeout (if any) and set a new one
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      if (trailing) {
        invokeFunc();
      }
      timeout = null;
    }, wait);
  };

  // Return the debounced function
  return debounced;
}

// Example usage:

const logMessage = (message) => {
  console.log(message);
};

const debouncedLog = debounce(logMessage, 1000, true, true);

// Simulating rapid function calls
debouncedLog('Hello!');
debouncedLog('How are you?');
debouncedLog('Good morning!');

// Output:
// "Hello!" (Immediately after first call due to leading = true)
// "Good morning!" (After 1 second, due to trailing = true)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Leading Execution (`leading = true`)**: If this flag is set to `true`, the function will be invoked immediately on the first call.
2. **Trailing Execution (`trailing = true`)**: If this flag is set to `true`, the function will be invoked once again after the delay period if the user stops triggering the event.
3. **Timeout Management**: We use `setTimeout` to wait for the specified delay (`wait`). The timeout is cleared and reset every time the debounced function is called.
4. **Invoke Logic**: We check the time elapsed since the last invocation using `Date.now()` and determine whether it’s time to call the function based on the trailing/leading flags.

### Use Case Example:
In a search input box, we can debounce the search function so that network requests are only made after the user stops typing for a certain amount of time.

```javascript
const search = (query) => {
  console.log(`Searching for: ${query}`);
};

const debouncedSearch = debounce(search, 500, true, true);

document.getElementById("searchInput").addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
});
```

In this case, the `debouncedSearch` function will only invoke the `search` function after the user stops typing for 500 milliseconds. It will invoke the function once at the beginning of typing (due to `leading: true`) and once again after the user finishes typing (due to `trailing: true`).

### Variations:
1. **Debounce with Leading only**: If you only want the function to execute at the start of the delay (ignoring the trailing behavior), you can call `debounce(func, wait, true, false)`.
2. **Debounce with Trailing only**: If you want the function to execute only after the delay period (ignoring the leading behavior), use `debounce(func, wait, false, true)`.

### Conclusion:
This debouncing technique with leading and trailing execution flags gives you fine-grained control over when the debounced function should be triggered, both at the start and end of the delay period. It can be highly useful in scenarios like search input fields, window resize handling, and scroll events to improve performance and reduce unnecessary computations.



Here’s an explanation and a refined implementation of the `debounce` function with both **leading** and **trailing** options:

---

### **Concept Explanation**

The debounce function can operate in three modes based on the provided `option`:

1. **Leading**: The function is invoked immediately when the debounced function is called for the first time.
2. **Trailing**: The function is invoked after the specified `delay` once the debounced function is no longer being called.
3. **Both Leading and Trailing**: The function is invoked at the beginning and again after the delay if there are further calls during the debounce period.

---

### **Refined Implementation**

```javascript
const debounce = (fn, delay, option = { leading: true, trailing: true }) => {
  let timeout;

  return function (...args) {
    const context = this;
    const shouldInvokeImmediately = option.leading && !timeout;

    // Clear the previous timeout
    clearTimeout(timeout);

    // Set a new timeout
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      if (option.trailing && !shouldInvokeImmediately) {
        fn.apply(context, args);
      }
      timeout = null; // Reset timeout
    }, delay);

    // If leading is enabled and there's no active timeout, invoke immediately
    if (shouldInvokeImmediately) {
      fn.apply(context, args);
    }
  };
};

// Example usage
const onChange = (e) => {
  console.log("Input value:", e.target.value);
};

const debouncedSearch = debounce(onChange, 1000, { leading: true, trailing: true });

// Attach to an input element
const input = document.getElementById("search");
input.addEventListener("keyup", debouncedSearch);
```

### **Key Points**

1. **Immediate Invocation**: Controlled by the `leading` option.
   - If `leading` is `true`, the function will execute immediately on the first call.
   - Subsequent calls within the debounce delay period will not invoke the function again until the timeout expires.

2. **Delayed Invocation**: Controlled by the `trailing` option.
   - If `trailing` is `true`, the function will execute after the debounce delay if no new calls are made.

3. **Both Options Enabled**:
   - If both `leading` and `trailing` are enabled, the function will execute immediately and then execute again after the delay period, provided there are calls during the debounce period.

### **Testing the Function**

#### Example HTML for Testing:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Debounce Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Type something...">
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Expected Behavior:
1. If you type rapidly, the `onChange` function will log the input value only at the leading edge (immediate) and trailing edge (after delay).
2. If you stop typing, it will only log once after the delay.

This implementation ensures flexibility and covers all edge cases while remaining easy to integrate into real-world applications.
