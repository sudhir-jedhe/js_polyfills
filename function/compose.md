The function `compose` you've provided is a great implementation of function composition, which allows you to combine multiple functions into a single function. Let's break it down and clarify the logic behind it, as well as review the example you've given.

### How `compose` Works

The `compose` function takes multiple functions as arguments using the rest parameter `...fns` (a spread operator). It returns a new function that applies these functions from right to left on an input value `x`.

Here’s a breakdown:

1. **`fns.reduceRight`**: 
   - `reduceRight` is similar to `reduce`, but it processes the array in reverse order. It takes an accumulator `y` (which starts as `x`) and a function `f` from the array, and applies `f` to the accumulator.
   
2. **Return Value**:
   - The result of applying all the functions from right to left is returned from the new function generated by `compose`.

### Example Explanation

Given three functions:

- `add1`: Adds 1 to the input.
- `multiplyBy2`: Multiplies the input by 2.
- `subtract3`: Subtracts 3 from the input.

When you compose these functions in the order `compose(subtract3, multiplyBy2, add1)`, the order of execution becomes:
- First, `add1` is applied.
- Then, `multiplyBy2` is applied to the result of `add1`.
- Finally, `subtract3` is applied to the result of `multiplyBy2`.

So, calling `composedFunction(5)` performs the following steps:
1. `add1(5)` → 6
2. `multiplyBy2(6)` → 12
3. `subtract3(12)` → 9

Thus, the output is `9`.

### Code Implementation

Here's the complete implementation of `compose`, along with the example you provided:

```javascript
// compose function that takes multiple functions as arguments
function compose(...fns) {
  return (x) => fns.reduceRight((y, f) => f(y), x);
}

// Example functions
const add1 = (x) => x + 1;
const multiplyBy2 = (x) => x * 2;
const subtract3 = (x) => x - 3;

// Composing the functions
const composedFunction = compose(subtract3, multiplyBy2, add1);

// Testing the composed function
console.log(composedFunction(5)); // Output: 9
```

### Example Breakdown:

1. **Input**: `5`
2. **Execution**:
   - `add1(5)` → 6
   - `multiplyBy2(6)` → 12
   - `subtract3(12)` → 9
3. **Output**: `9`

### More Examples

```javascript
const double = (x) => x * 2;
const square = (x) => x * x;

const composedExample = compose(double, square);
console.log(composedExample(3));  // Output: 18 (square(3) = 9, double(9) = 18)

const subtract5 = (x) => x - 5;
const divideBy3 = (x) => x / 3;

const anotherComposedExample = compose(subtract5, divideBy3);
console.log(anotherComposedExample(15));  // Output: 0 (divideBy3(15) = 5, subtract5(5) = 0)
```

### Conclusion

- The `compose` function allows you to apply a sequence of functions in reverse order. This is particularly useful in functional programming patterns where the order of operations is important.
- The use of `reduceRight` is key to applying functions in the correct order.
