The goal of the `customExpect` function is to mimic the behavior of testing assertions like `expect(actual).toBe(expected)` and `expect(actual).not.toBe(expected)` often used in testing frameworks like Jest. Let's break down the implementation and go through the various approaches you've presented.

### **Key Features**:
1. **`toBe(expected)`**: Checks if `actual` is equal to `expected`. If not, it throws an error.
2. **`not.toBe(expected)`**: Checks if `actual` is not equal to `expected`. If they are equal, it throws an error.
3. **Error Handling**: When assertions fail, they should throw an error with a meaningful message.

### Let's look at your solutions and provide a final working version.

### **Solution 1: Basic Approach**

```javascript
function customExpect(actual) {
  return {
    toBe(expected) {
      if (expected !== actual) throw new Error();
    },
    not: {
      toBe(expected) {
        if (expected === actual) throw new Error();
      },
    },
  };
}
```

This solution works, but it throws an error without a message, which isn't very helpful for debugging. Additionally, the structure works fine but doesn't include the expected error message when things go wrong.

### **Solution 2: Enhanced Error Messages**

```javascript
function customExpect(actual) {
  return {
    toBe(expected) {
      if (actual === expected) {
        // No error, do not return anything
      } else {
        throw new Error(`Expected ${actual} to be ${expected}`);
      }
    },
    not: {
      toBe(expected) {
        if (actual !== expected) {
          // No error, do not return anything
        } else {
          throw new Error(`Expected ${actual} not to be ${expected}`);
        }
      },
    },
  };
}
```

In this solution, you've added error messages that indicate what was expected versus what was actual. This is helpful for debugging.

### **Solution 3: Using Helper Functions (`toBe` and `notToBe`)**

```javascript
function customExpect(actual) {
  function toBe(expected) {
    if (expected !== actual) {
      throw new Error(`Expected ${actual} to be ${expected}`);
    }
  }

  function notToBe(expected) {
    if (expected === actual) {
      throw new Error(`Expected ${actual} not to be ${expected}`);
    }
  }

  return {
    toBe,
    not: {
      toBe: notToBe,
    },
  };
}
```

This is a more modular approach where the logic for `toBe` and `notToBe` is separated into helper functions. This makes the code easier to maintain and extend. The error messages are also more descriptive.

### **Final Solution with Improvements**

To ensure the function works as expected and provides meaningful feedback, I would suggest this final version, which includes:
- Proper error messages for both `toBe` and `not.toBe`.
- A clean and maintainable structure using helper functions.

```javascript
function customExpect(actual) {
  function toBe(expected) {
    if (actual !== expected) {
      throw new Error(`Expected ${actual} to be ${expected}`);
    }
  }

  function notToBe(expected) {
    if (actual === expected) {
      throw new Error(`Expected ${actual} not to be ${expected}`);
    }
  }

  return {
    toBe,
    not: {
      toBe: notToBe,
    },
  };
}

// Example usage
try {
  customExpect(3).toBe(3); // no error
  console.log('Test passed');
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // should not be triggered
}

try {
  customExpect(2).toBe(3); // should throw an error
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // Expected 2 to be 3
}

try {
  customExpect(2).not.toBe(3); // no error
  console.log('Test passed');
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // should not be triggered
}

try {
  customExpect(2).not.toBe(2); // should throw an error
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e.message); // Expected 2 not to be 2
}
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **`toBe(expected)`**: Throws an error if `actual` is not equal to `expected`, with a clear message.
2. **`not.toBe(expected)`**: Throws an error if `actual` is equal to `expected`, with a clear message.
3. **Helper Functions**: The `toBe` and `notToBe` functions encapsulate the logic, making the code modular and easier to extend.
4. **Error Handling**: Custom error messages provide more clarity when the test fails.

### **Example Output**:
```sh
Test passed
Expected 2 to be 3
Test passed
Expected 2 not to be 2
```

This solution covers the functionality you need and is structured in a way that can be easily maintained and extended in the future.
