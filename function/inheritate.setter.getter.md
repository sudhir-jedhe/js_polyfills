Let's break down the behavior of the JavaScript code you've provided, step by step, to understand how inheritance works with getters and setters in classes.

### Code Breakdown

```javascript
let val = 0;

class A {
  set foo(_val) {
    val = _val;
  }
  get foo() {
    return val;
  }
}

class B extends A {}

class C extends A {
  get foo() {
    return val;
  }
}

const b = new B();
console.log(b.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' for object 'b'
b.foo = 1;           // Set 'foo' of object 'b' to 1
console.log(b.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' again for object 'b'

const c = new C();
console.log(c.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' for object 'c'
c.foo = 2;           // Set 'foo' of object 'c' to 2
console.log(c.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' again for object 'c'
console.log(b.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' for object 'b'
```

### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Global Variable:**
   ```javascript
   let val = 0;
   ```
   The `val` variable is initialized globally with the value `0`. This variable is used in both the `getter` and `setter` methods to store and retrieve the value of `foo`.

2. **Class `A`:**
   ```javascript
   class A {
     set foo(_val) {
       val = _val;
     }
     get foo() {
       return val;
     }
   }
   ```
   - `A` has a `getter` and a `setter` for the property `foo`. The `setter` assigns the argument `_val` to the global `val` variable, while the `getter` simply returns the global `val`.
   - This means that when the `foo` property is accessed on instances of `A` or its subclasses, it directly reads from and writes to the global `val`.

3. **Class `B`:**
   ```javascript
   class B extends A {}
   ```
   - `B` is a subclass of `A` but does not override the `getter` or `setter`. Therefore, `B` inherits the behavior of `A`'s `foo` property (i.e., using the global `val`).

4. **Class `C`:**
   ```javascript
   class C extends A {
     get foo() {
       return val;
     }
   }
   ```
   - `C` is another subclass of `A`, but it **overrides the `getter`** for `foo`. This means the `setter` for `foo` (inherited from `A`) remains the same, but the `getter` is explicitly defined in `C`. However, the logic of `getter` in `C` is identical to `A`'s, as it also returns the global `val`.

### Execution of the Code

Now, let's look at the execution of the code step by step:

1. **Creating an instance of `B`:**
   ```javascript
   const b = new B();
   console.log(b.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' for object 'b'
   ```
   - `b.foo` accesses the `getter` inherited from `A`. Since `val` is initially `0`, this will log `0`.

   ```javascript
   b.foo = 1;           // Set 'foo' of object 'b' to 1
   ```
   - This calls the `setter` inherited from `A`, which assigns `1` to the global variable `val`.

   ```javascript
   console.log(b.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' again for object 'b'
   ```
   - Now, `val` has been updated to `1`. So, `b.foo` will log `1`.

2. **Creating an instance of `C`:**
   ```javascript
   const c = new C();
   console.log(c.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' for object 'c'
   ```
   - `c.foo` accesses the `getter` of `C`, which also returns the global `val`. Since `val` is still `1` from the previous step, this logs `1`.

   ```javascript
   c.foo = 2;           // Set 'foo' of object 'c' to 2
   ```
   - This calls the `setter` inherited from `A`, which assigns `2` to the global `val`.

   ```javascript
   console.log(c.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' again for object 'c'
   ```
   - Now, `val` has been updated to `2`. So, `c.foo` will log `2`.

   ```javascript
   console.log(b.foo);  // Access the getter of 'foo' for object 'b'
   ```
   - Since both `b` and `c` share the same global `val`, and `val` is `2` after the previous step, `b.foo` will also log `2`.

### Final Output

```javascript
0   // First log of b.foo (from the getter of A)
1   // Second log of b.foo (after b.foo = 1, the setter of A)
1   // First log of c.foo (from the getter of C, which is the same as A's getter)
2   // Second log of c.foo (after c.foo = 2, the setter of A)
2   // Third log of b.foo (val is shared between b and c, so it is now 2)
```

### Summary

- **Inheritance of `getter` and `setter`:** In JavaScript, when a class inherits another class, it inherits all of the methods from the parent class, including `getters` and `setters`. If a subclass doesn't define its own `getter` or `setter`, it uses the ones from the parent class.
- **Global State (`val`):** The `getter` and `setter` in both `B` and `C` are working on the same global `val` variable, which is why when you modify `foo` in one instance (whether `b` or `c`), it affects the other instance as well.
- **Overriding the Getter:** In class `C`, the `getter` is overridden, but it still accesses the global `val`, so the behavior is identical to that of `A`. Even though the `getter` is defined in `C`, the result doesn't change because it doesn't introduce new behavior.
