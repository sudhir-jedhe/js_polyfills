### 1. **The `foo` and `bar` Function Example**

```js
var foo = function bar() {
  return "BFE";
};

console.log(foo());  // What will this log?
console.log(bar());  // What will this log?
```

#### Explanation:
- The function `foo` is assigned an anonymous function that is also named `bar` **inside** the function declaration.
- The name `bar` is **not accessible** outside of the function because it's defined within the function's scope. Therefore, calling `bar()` from outside the function will result in a **ReferenceError**.
- However, `foo` can be called from outside because it's assigned to a variable.

**Expected Output**:
```js
BFE        // The `foo()` invocation works, returning the result of the function.
Uncaught ReferenceError: bar is not defined  // The `bar()` invocation throws an error.
```

### 2. **The `typeof` and Function Example**

```js
function a() {}
const b = function () {};
const c = function d() {
  console.log(typeof d);  // Check the type of the function `d` before reassigning it.
  d = "e";  // This reassigns `d` to a string.
  console.log(typeof d);  // Check the type of `d` after reassignment.
};

console.log(typeof a); // What will this log?
console.log(typeof b); // What will this log?
console.log(typeof c); // What will this log?
console.log(typeof d); // What will this log?
c(); // Call the function `c()`
```

#### Explanation:
- `typeof a`: The function `a` is declared using a **function declaration**. `typeof a` will be `'function'`.
- `typeof b`: The function `b` is assigned using an **anonymous function expression** (assigned to a constant). `typeof b` will be `'function'`.
- `typeof c`: The function `c` is assigned to a **named function expression** (also an anonymous function assigned to a constant but has an internal name `d`). `typeof c` will be `'function'`.
- `typeof d`: This will throw a **ReferenceError** because `d` is defined **inside** the function `c`'s scope. It's not available outside the function and thus cannot be accessed in the global scope.

Inside the function `c`, `d` is a **named function expression** that gets overwritten by the string `'e'`. The first `typeof d` will return `'function'`, and after reassignment, `typeof d` will return `'string'`.

**Expected Output**:
```js
function     // typeof a is "function"
function     // typeof b is "function"
function     // typeof c is "function"
Uncaught ReferenceError: d is not defined // typeof d will cause an error outside `c()`

// Inside `c()`:
function     // typeof d is "function" before reassigning
string       // typeof d is "string" after reassigning d to "e"
```

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**

1. **Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions**:
   - Function declarations (like `function a() {}`) are hoisted and can be accessed even before they are defined in the code.
   - Function expressions (like `const b = function() {}`) are not hoisted and can only be accessed after their definition.

2. **Function Names**:
   - When you assign a function expression to a variable, the function's name (e.g., `bar`) is only available within the function's body, not in the outer scope.
   - Named function expressions (like `const c = function d() {}`) have a name (`d`) inside the function but the function itself is accessed through the variable `c`.

3. **Scoping and `typeof`**:
   - The `typeof` operator returns the type of the operand. For functions, `typeof` always returns `"function"`.
   - Variables defined inside a function (like `d` inside `c()`) are **local to that function** and not accessible in the global scope.
