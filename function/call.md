In the task you've provided, the goal is to implement a `callPolyfill` method for functions that will behave similarly to the built-in `Function.prototype.call()` method. It should allow you to call a function with a specific context (`this`) and any number of arguments, while avoiding the use of the built-in `call()` method.

Let's walk through the problem and then provide the solution:

### **Problem Breakdown**
You need to:
1. Set the context (`this`) of a function to a specific object (`obj`).
2. Pass any number of arguments to the function.
3. Ensure that the function is called correctly with the provided context and arguments.
4. After calling the function, clean up the temporary properties used to set the context.

### **Steps for Implementation**
1. **Create a temporary property** on the provided `obj` to hold the reference to the function (to avoid conflicts with existing properties).
2. **Invoke the function** using the newly created property.
3. **Delete the temporary property** to ensure no side effects on the `obj`.
4. Return the result of the function call.

### **Solution:**

```javascript
Function.prototype.callPolyfill = function (obj, ...args) {
  // Step 1: If the object is null or undefined, set it to the global context (`window` in browsers or `globalThis` in Node.js)
  obj = obj || globalThis;

  // Step 2: Create a unique property on the object to avoid overwriting existing properties
  const uniqueSymbol = Symbol('uniqueSymbol');
  
  // Step 3: Assign the function (that `callPolyfill` is called on) as a property of the object
  obj[uniqueSymbol] = this;

  // Step 4: Call the function with the correct context and arguments
  const result = obj[uniqueSymbol](...args);

  // Step 5: Clean up by deleting the temporary property
  delete obj[uniqueSymbol];

  // Step 6: Return the result of the function call
  return result;
};

// Example usage:
function tax(price, taxRate) {
  return `The cost of the ${this.item} is ${price * taxRate}`;
}

const result = tax.callPolyfill({ item: 'burger' }, 10, 1.1);
console.log(result); // "The cost of the burger is 11"
```

### **How It Works:**
- **Step 1:** If `obj` is not provided (i.e., `null` or `undefined`), it defaults to `globalThis`, ensuring compatibility across different environments (browser, Node.js, etc.).
- **Step 2:** A `uniqueSymbol` is created using `Symbol()`, ensuring that the temporary property added to `obj` is unique and won't collide with any existing properties.
- **Step 3:** The function (the one that `callPolyfill` is called on) is assigned to `obj[uniqueSymbol]`. This allows us to call it with the correct context (`this`).
- **Step 4:** The function is invoked with `obj` as its context and the provided arguments (`args`).
- **Step 5:** After the function call, the temporary property (`obj[uniqueSymbol]`) is deleted to avoid polluting the object.
- **Step 6:** The result of the function call is returned.

### **Example 1:**

```javascript
const fn = function add(b) {
  return this.a + b;
};

const result = fn.callPolyfill({ a: 5 }, 7);
console.log(result); // Output: 12
```

- **Explanation:** The function `add` uses the context `this.a`, and `callPolyfill` binds the context to `{ a: 5 }`. The result is `12` because `5 + 7 = 12`.

### **Example 2:**

```javascript
const fn = function tax(price, taxRate) {
  return `The cost of the ${this.item} is ${price * taxRate}`;
};

const result = fn.callPolyfill({ item: 'burger' }, 10, 1.1);
console.log(result); // Output: "The cost of the burger is 11"
```

- **Explanation:** The function `tax` uses the context `this.item`, and `callPolyfill` binds the context to `{ item: 'burger' }`. The result is `"The cost of the burger is 11"` because `10 * 1.1 = 11`.

### **Key Considerations:**
- The use of `Symbol()` ensures that the temporary property used to store the function reference does not interfere with any existing properties of `obj`.
- The solution works with both primitive values (like numbers or strings) and objects, as the context (`this`) is always properly set to `obj`.

This custom `callPolyfill` method effectively mimics the behavior of the native `Function.prototype.call()` method while adhering to the specified constraints.
