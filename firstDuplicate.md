Your implementation of the function `firstDuplicateCharacter` or `firstDuplicate` is focused on finding the first duplicate character in a given string. Let's walk through each approach you've used and highlight their advantages:

### Approach 1: Using an Object (`charCount`)

```javascript
function firstDuplicateCharacter(str) {
  const charCount = {};

  for (let char of str) {
    if (charCount[char]) {
      return char;
    } else {
      charCount[char] = true;
    }
  }

  return null; // No duplicate character found
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the usage of an object (`charCount`) to track the characters.
- The function loops through each character of the string and stores it in the object `charCount`. If a character already exists in the object, it returns that character as the first duplicate.
  
### Approach 2: Using a `Map`

```javascript
function firstDuplicateCharacter(str) {
  const charMap = new Map();

  for (let char of str) {
    // If the character is already in the map, return it
    if (charMap.has(char)) {
      return char;
    }
    // Otherwise, add the character to the map
    charMap.set(char, true);
  }

  return null;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the usage of a `Map`.
- Similar to the object approach, but here we use a `Map` instead of an object to track the characters.
- `charMap.has(char)` checks if the character is already stored in the map, and `charMap.set(char, true)` adds the character if it isn't found.

### Approach 3: Using a `Map` with a `for` loop

```javascript
function firstDuplicate(str) {
  const map = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    const num = str[i];

    if (map.get(num)) return num;

    map.set(num, true);
  }

  return null;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- This is another variation that uses a `Map`. The function loops through the string and checks if a character already exists in the map using `map.get(num)`. If it does, it immediately returns that character.

### Approach 4: Using a `Set` and `find`

```javascript
function firstDuplicate(str) {
  let set = new Set();
  let duplicate = [...str].find((char) => {
    if (set.has(char)) {
      return char;
    }
    set.add(char);
  });
  return duplicate ? duplicate : null;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the usage of a `Set`.
- Here, you convert the string to an array using `[...]` and then use the `find` method to check if a character has already been added to the set.
- If a character is found in the set, it returns it as the first duplicate.

### Example Usage:

```javascript
const inputString = "abcdefgahij";
const firstDuplicate = firstDuplicateCharacter(inputString);
console.log("First duplicate character:", firstDuplicate);  // Output: "a"

const inputString2 = "abcdefgabc";
const firstDuplicate2 = firstDuplicateCharacter(inputString2);
console.log("First duplicate character:", firstDuplicate2);  // Output: "a"

const inputString3 = "abcdefe";
console.log(firstDuplicate(inputString3));  // Output: "e"
```

### Comparison of Approaches:

- **Efficiency**: All these approaches have a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string, making them efficient for larger inputs.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The approaches using an object (`charCount`) or `Map` have **O(n)** space complexity.
  - The approach using a `Set` also has **O(n)** space complexity, as it stores each unique character.

### Conclusion:
- All approaches you provided are valid for finding the first duplicate character in a string.
- The **Set-based** solution (`Approach 4`) and the **Map-based** solutions (`Approach 2` and `Approach 3`) are the most elegant and concise for this problem.
- Among these, using a `Set` (`Approach 4`) is slightly more modern and easier to read, while still being efficient.

If you want the simplest and most readable version, I recommend using the **Set-based approach** (`Approach 4`).
