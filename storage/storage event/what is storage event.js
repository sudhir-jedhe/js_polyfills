// The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events.
// The syntax would be as below

window.onstorage = functionRef;

// Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler which logs the storage key and it's values

window.onstorage = function (e) {
  console.log(
    `"The ${e.key} key has been changed from ${e.oldValue} to ${e.newValue}.`
  );
};
