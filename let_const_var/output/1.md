In the given code snippet:

```javascript
let a = 10;
if (true) {
  let a = 20; 
  console.log(a, "inside"); // 20 inside
}
console.log(a, "outside"); // 10 outside
```

### Explanation:

- The `let` keyword is **block-scoped**, meaning the variable `a` declared inside the `if` block is independent of the variable `a` declared outside the `if` block.
- Inside the `if` block, the `let a = 20;` creates a new variable `a` that is accessible only within the block. This does not affect the value of the outer `a`.
- Outside the `if` block, the original `a = 10;` remains unchanged.

### Output:
- Inside the `if` block: `console.log(a, "inside");` logs `20 inside` because the inner `a` is `20`.
- Outside the `if` block: `console.log(a, "outside");` logs `10 outside` because the outer `a` is still `10`.

### Correct Answer:
**2: 20, "inside" and 10, "outside"**

This demonstrates how `let` provides block-scoping, ensuring variables declared in different blocks do not interfere with each other.
