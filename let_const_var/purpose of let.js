// The `let` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the `var` keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

let counter = 30;
if (counter === 30) {
  let counter = 31;
  console.log(counter); // 31
}
console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)
