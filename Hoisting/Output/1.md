The explanation provided is spot on! Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the output is as it is for both cases:

---

### **Case 1:**
```javascript
printHello();

printMessage();

function printHello() {
  console.log("Hello");

  function printMessage() {
    console.log("Good day");
  }
}
```

#### What happens?
1. **Hoisting of `printHello`**:
   - The `printHello` function is hoisted to the top of the scope. It is defined in the global scope and available for use before its declaration in the code.

2. **Calling `printHello`**:
   - When `printHello()` is called, the `console.log("Hello")` statement runs, printing `Hello`.

3. **`printMessage` inside `printHello`**:
   - The `printMessage` function is declared **within the scope of `printHello`**, making it a local function. It is not accessible outside `printHello`.

4. **Calling `printMessage` directly**:
   - The call to `printMessage()` outside of `printHello` results in a **ReferenceError** because `printMessage` is not defined in the global scope.

---

### **Case 2:**
```javascript
printHello();

function printHello() {
  printMessage();
  console.log("Hello");

  function printMessage() {
    console.log("Good day");
  }
}
```

#### What happens?
1. **Hoisting of `printHello`**:
   - As before, `printHello` is hoisted to the global scope and can be called before its declaration.

2. **Calling `printHello`**:
   - When `printHello()` is invoked:
     - The nested `printMessage()` function is called first.
     - The `console.log("Good day")` statement runs, printing `Good day`.
     - The `console.log("Hello")` statement runs, printing `Hello`.

3. **Scope of `printMessage`**:
   - The `printMessage` function is still scoped locally within `printHello` and not accessible outside, but since it is invoked inside `printHello`, there is no error.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Function declarations are hoisted**, but their scope matters:
  - If declared globally, they can be accessed anywhere in the script.
  - If declared within a function, they are local to that function and cannot be accessed from outside.
  
- In **Case 1**, the `printMessage` function is declared inside `printHello`, so it is inaccessible globally, causing a `ReferenceError`.

- In **Case 2**, `printMessage` is called within its local scope (`printHello`), so no error occurs, and the output is:

   ```
   Good day
   Hello
   ```
