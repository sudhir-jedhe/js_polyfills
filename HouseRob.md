Your solution to the "House Robber" problem is great! Both versions of the code use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to efficiently calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed without triggering the security alarms in adjacent houses. Let's walk through the details of both versions.

### Problem Breakdown:
The task is to determine the maximum amount of money you can rob from a list of houses, where adjacent houses cannot be robbed on the same night due to security alarms.

The general approach is:
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We want to maximize the amount we can rob without robbing two adjacent houses.
2. For each house, we have two options:
   - Either **skip** the current house and take the maximum robbed money up to the previous house.
   - Or **rob** the current house and add its money to the maximum robbed money up to the house two steps back.

### Explanation of Both Versions:

### 1. First Version:
```javascript
function rob(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];
    
    let n = nums.length;
    let dp = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    dp[0] = nums[0]; // First house, we can only rob it
    dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]); // Second house, choose the better of the two

    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        // Either skip the current house, or rob it and add to the result of house i-2
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i]);
    }
    
    return dp[n-1]; // Return the last value, which contains the maximum amount we can rob
}
```

#### Key Steps:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If there are no houses (`nums.length === 0`), return 0.
   - If there is only one house, return its value.
   
2. **DP Array**:
   - `dp[i]` holds the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.
   - `dp[0]` is simply the value of the first house, and `dp[1]` is the maximum of the first two houses.
   
3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each subsequent house `i` (starting from 2), calculate the maximum of either:
     - Robbing the current house (`nums[i] + dp[i-2]`), or
     - Skipping the current house (`dp[i-1]`).

4. **Final Answer**: Return `dp[n-1]`, which contains the maximum amount we can rob considering all houses.

### 2. Second Version:
```javascript
function rob(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];
  
    const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(0);
  
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
  
    for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i] + dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1]);
    }
  
    return dp[nums.length - 1];
}
```

#### Key Differences:
- **Simplified Base Case**: This version is almost identical to the first but uses a simpler approach to filling the `dp` array.
- It immediately initializes the first two entries (`dp[0]` and `dp[1]`), and the loop continues as before.
- The recurrence relation inside the loop is slightly more compact (`nums[i] + dp[i - 2]` vs. `dp[i-2] + nums[i]`), but they are functionally equivalent.
  
The logic and time complexity of both versions are the same.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of houses. You loop through the houses once, and each iteration does a constant amount of work.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the `dp` array used to store the results.

### Optimized Space Complexity:
If you wanted to optimize the space complexity, you could reduce the `dp` array to just two variables since at each step you only need the last two values (`dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`). Here's the optimized version:

```javascript
function rob(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    if (nums.length === 1) return nums[0];

    let prev1 = nums[0];  // dp[i-1]
    let prev2 = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]); // dp[i-2]

    for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let temp = prev2;
        prev2 = Math.max(nums[i] + prev1, prev2);
        prev1 = temp;
    }

    return prev2;
}
```

### Space Complexity:
- **Optimized Space Complexity**: O(1), because you only need to store the last two values.

### Example Walkthrough:

**Example 1:**
```javascript
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
```

- Base Case: `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 2`.
- For `i = 2`: `dp[2] = Math.max(3 + dp[0], dp[1]) = Math.max(3 + 1, 2) = 4`.
- For `i = 3`: `dp[3] = Math.max(1 + dp[1], dp[2]) = Math.max(1 + 2, 4) = 4`.

**Output**: `4`.

**Example 2:**
```javascript
nums = [2, 7, 9, 3, 1]
```

- Base Case: `dp[0] = 2`, `dp[1] = 7`.
- For `i = 2`: `dp[2] = Math.max(9 + dp[0], dp[1]) = Math.max(9 + 2, 7) = 11`.
- For `i = 3`: `dp[3] = Math.max(3 + dp[1], dp[2]) = Math.max(3 + 7, 11) = 11`.
- For `i = 4`: `dp[4] = Math.max(1 + dp[2], dp[3]) = Math.max(1 + 11, 11) = 12`.

**Output**: `12`.

### Conclusion:
Your solution is already optimal, with a time complexity of **O(n)** and space complexity of **O(n)**. If needed, the space complexity can be optimized to **O(1)** by using only two variables instead of a full DP array. Let me know if you'd like any further clarifications!
