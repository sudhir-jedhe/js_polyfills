### Problem Breakdown:

We are given an array of words, and we need to find how many **unique Morse code transformations** exist for the words. Each word is converted to Morse code by transforming each of its characters into its corresponding Morse code, then concatenating these transformations to form a single string.

The goal is to return the count of distinct Morse code transformations among all the words.

### Solution Explanation:

1. **Morse Code Table**: 
   The `codes` array defines the Morse code mapping for each letter from 'a' to 'z'. The position in this array corresponds to the letter's position in the alphabet (i.e., `codes[0]` is for 'a', `codes[1]` is for 'b', etc.).

2. **Word Transformation**:
   For each word in the input list:
   - Convert each character of the word to its corresponding Morse code.
   - Concatenate these codes together to form a single string (this represents the transformed word).

3. **Unique Transformations**:
   To count how many unique transformations exist, we can use a `Set` to store the transformed strings, because a `Set` only keeps unique values.

4. **Steps in the Function**:
   - For each word, split it into individual characters.
   - For each character, map it to its corresponding Morse code using the `codes` array.
   - Join the Morse codes together to form the transformation of the word.
   - Add the transformation to a `Set` to ensure uniqueness.
   - Finally, return the size of the `Set`, which gives the number of unique transformations.

### Code:

```typescript
const codes = [
    '.-',       // a
    '-...',     // b
    '-.-.',     // c
    '-..',      // d
    '.',        // e
    '..-.',     // f
    '--.',      // g
    '....',     // h
    '..',       // i
    '.---',     // j
    '-.-',      // k
    '.-..',     // l
    '--',       // m
    '-.',       // n
    '---',      // o
    '.--.',     // p
    '--.-',     // q
    '.-.',      // r
    '...',      // s
    '-',        // t
    '..-',      // u
    '...-',     // v
    '.--',      // w
    '-..-',     // x
    '-.--',     // y
    '--..',     // z
];

function uniqueMorseRepresentations(words: string[]): number {
    // Create a set to store unique Morse code transformations
    const morseSet = new Set(
        words.map(word => {
            return word
                .split('')                  // Split each word into individual characters
                .map(c => codes[c.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]) // Map each character to its Morse code
                .join('');                  // Join the Morse codes to form the transformation
        })
    );
    
    // The size of the set will give the count of unique transformations
    return morseSet.size;
}

// Example 1
const words1 = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"];
console.log(uniqueMorseRepresentations(words1)); // Output: 2

// Example 2
const words2 = ["a"];
console.log(uniqueMorseRepresentations(words2)); // Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Morse Code Mapping**:
   - The `codes` array is indexed from 0 to 25, where each index corresponds to a letter from 'a' to 'z'. For example, `codes[0]` is `".-"`, which is the Morse code for 'a'.

2. **Mapping Words to Morse Code**:
   - For each word, we first split it into individual characters.
   - For each character, we calculate its index by using `charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)`. This gives the position of the letter in the alphabet (e.g., for 'a', it gives 0, for 'b', it gives 1, and so on).
   - We then use this index to fetch the corresponding Morse code from the `codes` array.
   - All the Morse codes of the letters are then concatenated to form the complete Morse code transformation of the word.

3. **Using a Set to Track Unique Transformations**:
   - The transformations are stored in a `Set`, which ensures that only unique Morse code strings are kept.
   - Finally, the size of the `Set` is returned, which represents the number of unique transformations.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```javascript
words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
```

- `"gin"`:
  - 'g' → `--.`
  - 'i' → `..`
  - 'n' → `-.`
  - Morse code for `"gin"` → `--...-.`

- `"zen"`:
  - 'z' → `--..`
  - 'e' → `.`
  - 'n' → `-.`
  - Morse code for `"zen"` → `--...-.`

- `"gig"`:
  - 'g' → `--.`
  - 'i' → `..`
  - 'g' → `--.`
  - Morse code for `"gig"` → `--...--.`

- `"msg"`:
  - 'm' → `--`
  - 's' → `...`
  - 'g' → `--.`
  - Morse code for `"msg"` → `--...--.`

So, the unique Morse code transformations are `["--...-.", "--...--."]`, and thus the output is `2`.

#### Example 2:
```javascript
words = ["a"]
```

- `"a"`:
  - 'a' → `.-`
  - Morse code for `"a"` → `.-`

Since there is only one word, the output is `1`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n * m)** where:
  - `n` is the number of words in the array.
  - `m` is the average length of each word.
  This is because:
  - For each word, we are splitting it into characters (O(m)) and then mapping each character to its Morse code (O(1) operation per character).
  - We are also adding the result to a `Set`, which typically has O(1) complexity for insertion.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n * m)**, because:
  - We store each word's transformation (up to `m` characters) in the `Set`.
  - In the worst case, all transformations could be unique, and thus the space used by the `Set` could grow proportionally to the size of the input.

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently computes the number of unique Morse code transformations by utilizing a `Set` to store and count distinct transformations. It performs well with a time complexity of **O(n * m)** and a space complexity of **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the length of the longest word.
