You've presented multiple solutions for computing the Fibonacci number, each of which has its pros and cons. Let's break them down:

### 1. **Iterative Solution (Normal Solution)**

```javascript
var fib = function (n) {
  const arr = [0, 1];

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    arr.push(arr[i - 1] + arr[i - 2]);
  }

  return arr[n];
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Base cases:** The array `arr` starts with `[0, 1]`, representing `F(0)` and `F(1)`.
- **Iteration:** A `for` loop runs from `2` to `n` to calculate the Fibonacci numbers and store them in the array `arr`.
- **Efficiency:**
  - **Time complexity:** **O(n)**, because we iterate over `n` numbers.
  - **Space complexity:** **O(n)**, because we store all Fibonacci numbers up to `n` in an array.
  
#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(fib(3));  // Output: 2 (F(3) = 2)
```

---

### 2. **Recursive Solution (Naive)**

```javascript
const fib = function (n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;

  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Base cases:** If `n` is `0` or `1`, return `n` (i.e., `F(0)` = 0, `F(1)` = 1).
- **Recursive step:** Otherwise, it recursively calls `fib(n - 1)` and `fib(n - 2)` to calculate the Fibonacci numbers.
- **Efficiency:**
  - **Time complexity:** **O(2^n)**, because each function call generates two additional recursive calls, leading to exponential growth.
  - **Space complexity:** **O(n)** for the recursion stack (since we go `n` levels deep).

This solution works but is **inefficient for larger values of `n`** due to excessive recomputation (repeated calls for the same Fibonacci numbers).

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(fib(3));  // Output: 2 (F(3) = 2)
```

---

### 3. **One-Liner Recursive Solution**

```javascript
const fib = (n) => (n <= 1 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2));
```

### Explanation:
- This is essentially the same as the recursive solution but condensed into a one-liner using a ternary operator for the base case.
- The functionality and inefficiency are identical to the previous recursive solution.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(fib(3));  // Output: 2 (F(3) = 2)
```

---

### Optimizing the Recursive Solution: **Memoization**

You can improve the recursive solution with **memoization**, which stores the results of previous calculations and reuses them to avoid redundant work. This reduces the time complexity to **O(n)** and the space complexity to **O(n)** (for the cache).

```javascript
const fib = (n, memo = {}) => {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];  // Return the result if already computed
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  
  memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);  // Store the result in the memo object
  return memo[n];
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Memoization:** A `memo` object is used to store the Fibonacci numbers as they are computed.
- **Efficiency:** By using memoization, we only compute each Fibonacci number once, thus reducing time complexity to **O(n)**.
  
#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(fib(3));  // Output: 2 (F(3) = 2)
```

---

### 4. **Space-Optimized Iterative Solution**

If you're concerned about space complexity, you can optimize the iterative solution to only store the last two Fibonacci numbers instead of an entire array:

```javascript
var fib = function (n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  
  let a = 0, b = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    let temp = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
  }
  return b;
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Space optimization:** We use two variables `a` and `b` to store only the last two Fibonacci numbers.
- **Efficiency:**
  - **Time complexity:** **O(n)** (same as the previous iterative solution).
  - **Space complexity:** **O(1)**, since we're only using two variables.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(fib(3));  // Output: 2 (F(3) = 2)
```

### Summary of Approaches:

| Solution                     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Iterative (Normal)**        | O(n)            | O(n)             |
| **Naive Recursive**           | O(2^n)          | O(n)             |
| **One-Liner Recursive**       | O(2^n)          | O(n)             |
| **Memoization**               | O(n)            | O(n)             |
| **Space-Optimized Iterative** | O(n)            | O(1)             |

### Recommended Solution:
- **For small `n`:** The naive recursive solution or one-liner might be fine.
- **For large `n`:** Use either **memoization** or the **space-optimized iterative solution**, as they offer the best time and space complexities.
