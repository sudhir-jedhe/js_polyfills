| **Usage**                 | Group larger sections, structure layouts           | Style small sections of text or inline elements   |
| **Display**               | Takes up full width, causing line breaks           | Does not break the flow of text                   |
| **Common Use Cases**      | - Sectioning content (e.g., divs for sections or containers) <br> - Grouping other block-level elements | - Wrapping text or small inline elements for styling <br> - Targeting small portions of text for manipulation |
| **Examples**              | `<div class="container">Content</div>`             | `<span class="highlight">Important</span>`        |

**Detailed Explanation:**
**1. `<div>`: Block-Level Element**
The `<div>` tag is a block-level element, which means it takes up the full width available to it, pushing other content to the next line.
It's often used for creating larger structural elements or containers on the page. It's a generic container with no inherent styling or meaning.

Typically used for sectioning the page into larger, independent parts (e.g., creating sections, sidebars, headers, footers).
Example:

```js
<div class="container">
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a section of content.</p>
</div>
```
Here, the `<div>` creates a block around the content that typically spans the full width of its parent container.

**2. `<span>`: Inline Element**
The `<span>` tag is an inline element, which means it does not break the flow of content. It only takes up as much width as its content.
Itâ€™s typically used to style small portions of content within a larger block of text, or group together inline elements for manipulation (e.g., styling specific words or phrases).
Since `<span>` does not cause a line break, it stays within the flow of surrounding text or inline elements.
Example:

```js
<p>This is a <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> word in a sentence.</p>
```

In this example, the `<span>` element highlights the word "highlighted" without disrupting the surrounding text flow.

**When to Use `<div>` and When to Use` <span>`?**
**Use `<div> `when:**

You need a container for block-level content (e.g., large sections, layouts).
You want to divide a webpage into larger sections for styling or layout purposes.
You need a flexbox or grid container to manage layout.
**Use `<span> `when:**

You want to apply styles or manipulations to a small portion of inline content without changing the layout.
You want to wrap text or inline elements for specific styling, like changing color or font style.
**Example Combining `<div> and <span>:`**
```js
<div class="header">
  <h1>Welcome to My <span class="highlight">Awesome</span> Website</h1>
  <p>Find all the latest content below.</p>
</div>
The <div> is used to group the entire header as a block-level element.
The <span> is used to highlight the word "Awesome" without interrupting the flow of the heading text.
