### Generic Types in TypeScript

**Generics** in TypeScript allow you to write flexible and reusable code while maintaining type safety. They enable you to define functions, classes, interfaces, or type aliases that work with any data type, without losing the benefits of type checking.

In simple terms, generics let you define a "placeholder" for a type that can be replaced with any specific type later when you call the function or instantiate the class.

---

### Why Use Generics?

- **Reusability**: You can write functions and classes that work with multiple data types, reducing duplication.
- **Type Safety**: You still get all the benefits of TypeScript’s static type checking while working with a variety of data types.
- **Flexibility**: You can define operations or data structures that can work with multiple types without losing the structure and safety of your code.

### Syntax of Generics

Generics are defined by using angle brackets (`<T>`) or any other identifier for the generic type.

```typescript
function example<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}
```

Here:
- `T` is a **type parameter** that represents a placeholder for any type.
- When you call `example`, you can specify the actual type for `T`.

### Examples of Generics in TypeScript

#### 1. **Generic Function**

You can define a function that accepts and returns a value of a generic type.

```typescript
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
    return value;
}

const result1 = identity("Hello");  // T is inferred to be string
const result2 = identity(42);       // T is inferred to be number
```

In the above example:
- The function `identity` takes an argument `value` of type `T` and returns a value of type `T`.
- TypeScript infers the type of `T` based on the argument passed (either `string` or `number`).

#### 2. **Generic Interfaces**

You can use generics in interfaces to define flexible data structures.

```typescript
interface Box<T> {
    value: T;
}

const stringBox: Box<string> = { value: "Hello" };
const numberBox: Box<number> = { value: 42 };
```

In the example:
- `Box` is a generic interface that accepts any type `T`.
- When we create instances like `stringBox` or `numberBox`, TypeScript knows the specific types (`string` or `number`) of `value` in each case.

#### 3. **Generic Classes**

Generics can also be used in classes to define reusable and type-safe data structures.

```typescript
class Container<T> {
    private items: T[] = [];
    
    add(item: T): void {
        this.items.push(item);
    }

    getItems(): T[] {
        return this.items;
    }
}

const stringContainer = new Container<string>();
stringContainer.add("Hello");
console.log(stringContainer.getItems());  // Output: ["Hello"]

const numberContainer = new Container<number>();
numberContainer.add(42);
console.log(numberContainer.getItems());  // Output: [42]
```

In this example:
- `Container` is a generic class that works with any type `T`.
- We create instances of `Container` for `string` and `number`, and TypeScript ensures type safety when adding and retrieving items.

#### 4. **Generic Constraints**

You can also constrain the types that can be used with generics, by using `extends`.

```typescript
function logLength<T extends { length: number }>(item: T): void {
    console.log(item.length);
}

logLength("Hello");  // Works because string has a 'length' property
logLength([1, 2, 3]); // Works because arrays have a 'length' property
// logLength(42);  // Error: number doesn't have a 'length' property
```

In this example:
- `T extends { length: number }` means that `T` must be a type that has a `length` property (e.g., `string`, `Array`).
- We restrict `T` to types that include the `length` property, such as `string` or arrays.

#### 5. **Generic Constraints with Multiple Types**

You can also combine multiple constraints in generics.

```typescript
interface Nameable {
    name: string;
}

function greet<T extends Nameable>(entity: T): void {
    console.log(`Hello, ${entity.name}`);
}

const person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
greet(person);  // Works fine

const animal = { name: "Buddy", breed: "Golden Retriever" };
greet(animal);  // Works fine
```

Here:
- The generic `T` extends the `Nameable` interface, meaning `T` must be an object with a `name` property.
- You can pass any object with a `name` property (e.g., `person`, `animal`).

#### 6. **Generic Type Aliases**

You can also define generic types using type aliases.

```typescript
type Pair<T, U> = {
    first: T;
    second: U;
};

const pair1: Pair<string, number> = { first: "Hello", second: 42 };
const pair2: Pair<boolean, string> = { first: true, second: "World" };
```

In this example:
- `Pair` is a generic type alias that takes two type parameters: `T` and `U`.
- You can create pairs of different types by specifying the types when you instantiate the `Pair`.

### Key Advantages of Generics

1. **Type Safety**: Generics allow you to write reusable code while maintaining the integrity of the types, which reduces runtime errors.
2. **Flexibility**: You can create generic functions and classes that work with any type, providing a lot of flexibility while still being type-safe.
3. **Code Reusability**: By writing generic code, you reduce duplication and make your code more maintainable and modular.

### Conclusion

Generics in TypeScript provide a powerful way to write flexible, reusable, and type-safe code. They allow you to define functions, classes, and interfaces that can work with any type, but still ensure that the type information is preserved across the program. By using generics, you can significantly reduce code duplication and improve type safety in your TypeScript code.
