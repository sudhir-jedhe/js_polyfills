Based on recent React masterclass material in your organisation, API integration topics such as Axios, Fetch API, useEffect, Context API, and state management are common areas of focus. [[React-PPT-v4 2 | PDF]](https://persistentsystems-my.sharepoint.com/personal/bhagyashri_vikhe_persistent_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/React-PPT-v4%202.pdf?web=1), [[Masterclas...: July'26 | Meeting]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkAGMxMjI2OWVkLWU0NzItNGZhMS04MWEyLWU0MTBmNzhiZjM3NAFRAAgI3uBxrrHAAEYAAAAAXK7K1kVmlUyuqsmSw-3huAcA65BX0zds3kuv4N8YqlYGvQAAAAABDQAA65BX0zds3kuv4N8YqlYGvQAChF1zKQAAEA%3d%3d)

# React API Integration Interview Questions (Senior/Architect Level)

## 1\. How do you fetch data in React?

**Answer:**

- `fetch()`
- `Axios`
- React Query (TanStack Query)
- SWR
- Server Components (React 19 / Next.js)

useEffect(() => {

  const fetchUsers = async () => {

    const res = await fetch('/api/users');

    const data = await res.json();

    setUsers(data);

  };

  fetchUsers();

}, []);

---

## 2\. Fetch vs Axios

| Feature              | Fetch           | Axios            |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Built-in             | ✅              | ❌               |
| JSON Parsing         | Manual          | Automatic        |
| Error Handling       | Limited         | Better           |
| Interceptors         | ❌              | ✅               |
| Request Cancellation | AbortController | Built-in support |

**When asked in interviews:**

> Fetch is sufficient for simple applications. Axios is preferred in enterprise applications because of interceptors, request transformation, and centralised error handling.

---

## 3\. Where should API calls be placed?

### Good

useEffect(() => {

  loadData();

}, []);

### Better

Move API logic into service layer:

// userService.js

export const getUsers = () => axios.get('/users');

Benefits:

- Separation of concerns
- Easier testing
- Reusable APIs

---

## 4\. How do you handle loading and error states?

const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

const [error, setError] = useState(null);

try {

  setLoading(true);

  const users = await getUsers();

} catch (err) {

  setError(err);

} finally {

  setLoading(false);

}

### Interview Follow-up

What happens if API fails?

- Show fallback UI
- Retry mechanism
- Log error
- Display user-friendly message

---

## 5\. How do you prevent memory leaks in API calls?

### Problem

User navigates away before API completion.

useEffect(() => {

  fetch('/users')

    .then(res => res.json())

    .then(setUsers);

}, []);

### Solution

useEffect(() => {

  const controller = new AbortController();

  fetch('/users', {

    signal: controller.signal

  });

  return () => controller.abort();

}, []);

---

## 6\. How do you avoid duplicate API calls?

### Use Caching

const { data } = useQuery({

  queryKey: ['users'],

  queryFn: fetchUsers

});

Benefits:

- Cache
- Deduplication
- Background refetching
- Retry support

---

## 7\. What is React Query?

React Query manages:

- Fetching
- Caching
- Synchronization
- Background refresh
- Retry logic

const {

  data,

  isLoading,

  error

} = useQuery({

  queryKey: ['users'],

  queryFn: fetchUsers

});

### Architect Answer

React Query eliminates boilerplate code around API state management.

---

## 8\. How do you handle authentication tokens?

### Axios Interceptor

axios.interceptors.request.use(config => {

  config.headers.Authorization =

    `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`;

  return config;

});

``

### Follow-Up

Where should token be stored?

- HTTP Only Cookie ✅
- LocalStorage ⚠️
- Session Storage ⚠️

---

## 9\. How do you handle multiple API requests?

### Parallel

const [users, products] = await Promise.all([

  fetchUsers(),

  fetchProducts()

]);

### Benefit

Reduces overall network time.

---

## 10\. How do you design API architecture in a large React application?

```
src/
 ├── api/
 │   ├── axiosInstance.js
 │   ├── userApi.js
 │   └── productApi.js
 │
 ├── hooks/
 │   ├── useUsers.js
 │   └── useProducts.js
 │
 ├── pages/
 └── components/

```

### Advantages

- Reusable
- Testable
- Scalable
- Maintainable

Architect-Level Answer
Question:

"Dashboard has 20 widgets calling APIs simultaneously. What would you do?"

This question tests your understanding of:

Network optimisation
React performance
Backend scalability
User experience
Observability
First: Analyse the Problem

20 widgets firing APIs simultaneously can cause:

Network congestion
Browser connection limits
High server load
Slow dashboard rendering
Duplicate requests
UI blocking/spinners everywhere

1. Prioritise Critical Widgets

Not all widgets have equal importance.

Loading Strategy
Critical Widgets
├─ Revenue
├─ Alerts
└─ User Tasks

Secondary Widgets
├─ Trends
├─ Charts
└─ Reports

Load:

P0 → Immediately
P1 → After first render
P2 → Lazy load

Example:

const RevenueWidget = lazy(() =>
import("./RevenueWidget")
);

2. Parallelise Requests Properly

Instead of:

await getRevenue();
await getUsers();
await getCustomers();

Use:

await Promise.all([
getRevenue(),
getUsers(),
getCustomers()
]);

Benefits:

Reduced overall wait time
Better network utilisation 3. Use React Query (TanStack Query)

Most enterprise dashboards use:

const { data } = useQuery({
queryKey: ['revenue'],
queryFn: getRevenue,
staleTime: 60000
});

Benefits:

✅ Caching

✅ Background refetch

✅ Deduplication

✅ Retry handling

✅ Request cancellation

4. Eliminate Duplicate Calls

Bad scenario:

Widget A → GET /user
Widget B → GET /user
Widget C → GET /user

Use shared cache:

useQuery({
queryKey: ['user']
});

Only one request goes to server.

5. Backend Aggregation Pattern

Instead of:

20 Widgets
↓
20 APIs

Create:

Dashboard API
↓
/dashboard

Response:

{
"revenue": {},
"alerts": {},
"users": {},
"sales": {}
}

Advantages:

Single network call
Reduced latency
Reduced authentication overhead

Architects usually prefer this approach.

6. Lazy Load Below-the-Fold Widgets

Only render visible content.

<LazyWidget />

Using:

IntersectionObserver

Example:

const isVisible = useInView();

Load charts only when user scrolls.

7. Skeleton Loaders

Avoid:

20 spinners

Use:

<Skeleton height={200}/>

Benefits:

Better perceived performance
Less layout shift 8. Request Prioritisation

Critical API:

Revenue
Alerts
Notifications

High priority.

Non-critical:

Historical Trends
Reports
Analytics

Load later:

requestIdleCallback(() => {
loadReports();
});

9. Pagination and Virtualisation

If widget displays:

50,000 rows

Never fetch all data.

Use:

Server-side pagination

or

React Window
AG Grid Virtualization

10. Real-Time Widgets

Avoid:

setInterval(fetch, 1000);

Use:

WebSocket
Server-Sent Events (SSE)

Only changed data is pushed.

11. Fault Isolation

One widget failure should not crash dashboard.

<ErrorBoundary>
   <RevenueWidget />
</ErrorBoundary>

Result:

Revenue widget fails
↓
Other 19 widgets work

12. Monitoring

Track:

API Latency
Widget Render Time
FCP
LCP
CLS
INP
Error Rate

Using:

Browser Performance API
Azure App Insights
Datadog
New Relic
Architect-Level Answer (2-Minute Interview Version)

For a dashboard with 20 widgets, I would first classify widgets by business priority and load critical widgets first. I would execute independent requests in parallel using Promise.all, introduce React Query for caching, deduplication and background refresh, and avoid duplicate API calls through shared query keys. For scalability, I would prefer a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) or aggregated dashboard API instead of 20 separate network calls. I would lazy-load non-visible widgets, use skeleton screens for perceived performance, virtualise large datasets, isolate failures with Error Boundaries, and monitor real-user metrics using Browser Performance APIs and observability tools. This provides faster initial render, reduced server load, and better user experience at scale.

Follow-up Interview Question

"What if one API takes 10 seconds while the other 19 APIs finish in 500ms?"

Expected discussion:

Timeouts
Request cancellation (AbortController)
Partial rendering
Retry strategy with exponential backoff
Stale cache fallback
Circuit breaker pattern

});

This helps identify:

Revenue Widget → 100ms

Sales Widget → 150ms

Reports Widget → 4 sec ← Problem

---

# Alerting

Configure alerts:

Error Rate > 5%

P95 Latency > 2 sec

CPU > 80%

## Step 2: Create Application Insights Configuration

// appInsights.js

import { ApplicationInsights }

from "@microsoft/applicationinsights-web";

const appInsights =

  new ApplicationInsights({

    config: {

      connectionString:

        process.env.REACT_APP_APPINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING

    }

  });

appInsights.loadAppInsights();

export default appInsights;

Microsoft recommends using **connection strings** for new applications. [[persistent...epoint.com]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/Propeller%20Program/Batch%2023/Propeller%20group%204/Propeller_Team4/L-D/cloud-native-design/13-Multi-Cloud-Mapping.md?web=1)

---

## Step 3: Track Page Views

import { useEffect } from "react";

import appInsights from "./appInsights";

function Dashboard() {

  useEffect(() => {

    appInsights.trackPageView({

      name: "Dashboard"

    });

  }, []);

  return <h1>Dashboard</h1>;

}

Application Insights can track user interactions, sessions, events, and page activity. [[persistent...epoint.com]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/Propeller%20Program/Batch%2023/Propeller%20group%204/Propeller_Team4/L-D/cloud-native-design/13-Multi-Cloud-Mapping.md?web=1), [[Real Stori...eal Impact | SharePoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/SitePages/Real-Stories.aspx?web=1)

---

## Step 4: Track Custom Events

appInsights.trackEvent({

  name: "RevenueWidgetLoaded"

});

Useful for:

- Dashboard widget loads
- Button clicks
- Form submissions
- User journeys

[[persistent...epoint.com]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/Propeller%20Program/Batch%2023/Propeller%20group%204/Propeller_Team4/L-D/cloud-native-design/13-Multi-Cloud-Mapping.md?web=1), [[Real Stori...eal Impact | SharePoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/SitePages/Real-Stories.aspx?web=1)

---

## Step 5: Track Exceptions

try {

   await loadDashboard();

}

catch(error) {

   appInsights.trackException({

      exception: error

   });

}

Application Insights includes failure analysis and exception monitoring capabilities. [[persistent...epoint.com]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/Propeller%20Program/Batch%2023/Propeller%20group%204/Propeller_Team4/L-D/cloud-native-design/13-Multi-Cloud-Mapping.md?web=1), [[Real Stori...eal Impact | SharePoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/SitePages/Real-Stories.aspx?web=1)

---

## Step 6: Track API Performance

### Axios Interceptor Example

axios.interceptors.request.use(config => {

  config.metadata = {

    startTime: Date.now()

  };

  return config;

});

axios.interceptors.response.use(

  response => {

    const duration =

      Date.now() -

      response.config.metadata.startTime;

    appInsights.trackDependencyData({

      target: response.config.url,

      duration

    });

    return response;

  }

);

Application Insights supports dependency monitoring and performance analysis across service calls. [[persistent...epoint.com]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/Propeller%20Program/Batch%2023/Propeller%20group%204/Propeller_Team4/L-D/cloud-native-design/13-Multi-Cloud-Mapping.md?web=1), [[Real Stori...eal Impact | SharePoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/SitePages/Real-Stories.aspx?web=1)

---

## Step 7: Measure React Render Performance

useEffect(() => {

  performance.mark("start");

  return () => {

    performance.mark("end");

    performance.measure(

      "DashboardRender",

      "start",

      "end"

    );

  };

}, []);

Send custom measurements:

appInsights.trackMetric({

   name: "DashboardRenderTime",

   average: renderDuration

});

Application Insights can visualise metrics and trends for performance investigations. [[persistent...epoint.com]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/Propeller%20Program/Batch%2023/Propeller%20group%204/Propeller_Team4/L-D/cloud-native-design/13-Multi-Cloud-Mapping.md?web=1), [[Real Stori...eal Impact | SharePoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/SitePages/Real-Stories.aspx?web=1)

## Interview Answer (Senior/Lead Level)

> In React applications, I integrate the Application Insights JavaScript SDK using a connection string, then capture page views, custom events, exceptions, API dependencies, and performance metrics. In Azure, I configure Azure Monitor alerts for response times, failed requests, availability, and custom KQL queries. This provides end-to-end observability with dashboards, distributed tracing, proactive alerting, and faster production issue diagnosis. [[persistent...epoint.com]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/Propeller%20Program/Batch%2023/Propeller%20group%204/Propeller_Team4/L-D/cloud-native-design/13-Multi-Cloud-Mapping.md?web=1), [[Real Stori...eal Impact | SharePoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/SitePages/Real-Stories.aspx?web=1), [[AI_Intevie...d_00003240 | PDF]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/ResponsiveAssets/SLF/SLF%20AI-interview%20reports/HLS-SLF%20AI-interview%20reports/Myriad/AI_Inteview_Evaluation_Tushar%20Rathod_00003240.pdf?web=1)

# 3\. Correlation IDs

### Most Frequently Asked Interview Topic

A **Correlation ID** is a unique identifier attached to every request.

Example:

REQ-12345

Request flow:

Browser

↓

Gateway

↓

User Service

↓

Payment Service

↓

Database

All logs contain:

CorrelationId=REQ-12345

Example log:

[INFO]

CorrelationId=REQ-12345

User Login Started

[ERROR]

CorrelationId=REQ-12345

Database Timeout

Now you can trace the same transaction across dozens of microservices.

Internal engineering guidance explicitly recommends including correlation IDs in logs to support distributed tracing. [[dotnet-C#-...guidelines | PDF]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/D&OE/ProcessDocumentsRepository/dotnet-C#-coding-guidelines.pdf?web=1)

---

# Node.js Implementation

### Middleware

import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid';

app.use((req, res, next) => {

  req.correlationId = uuid();

  res.setHeader(

    'X-Correlation-ID',

    req.correlationId

  );

  next();

});

### Logging

logger.info({

   correlationId:

     req.correlationId

});

---

# 4\. API Latency Dashboards

Every production application should visualize API performance.

### Typical Dashboard

API Name

Average Latency

P95 Latency

P99 Latency

Requests/sec

Errors

Example:

GET /users

Avg  = 200ms

P95  = 900ms

P99  = 2500ms

### Why P95/P99?

Average hides problems.

Example:

99 requests = 100ms

1 request = 10sec

Average:

199ms

Looks healthy.

P99:

10 sec

Clearly unhealthy.

# Architect-Level Interview Answer

> In large-scale React and microservice systems, I use observability platforms such as Datadog or New Relic to collect metrics, logs, traces, and real-user monitoring data. Every request carries a correlation ID, allowing distributed tracing across services. API latency dashboards track P50, P95, and P99 response times, while error-rate monitoring helps detect service degradation before users are impacted. Combining tracing, dashboards, alerts, and correlation IDs significantly reduces MTTR and simplifies root-cause analysis. [[datadoghq.com]](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/apm/), [[docs.datadoghq.com]](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/), [[newrelic.com]](https://newrelic.com/platform/application-monitoring), [[dotnet-C#-...guidelines | PDF]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/D&OE/ProcessDocumentsRepository/dotnet-C#-coding-guidelines.pdf?web=1)

# Best Practices for Tracking API Dependencies in React with Application Insights

Microsoft's Application Insights automatically tracks AJAX/fetch/XHR dependencies in web applications and correlates dependency calls with requests, exceptions, and traces. For React applications, Microsoft also provides a dedicated React plugin that supports route tracking and component usage telemetry. [[learn.microsoft.com]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/dependencies), [[learn.microsoft.com]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/javascript-framework-extensions), [[npmjs.com]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js)

---

## 1\. Use the React Plugin

npm install </span>

  @microsoft/applicationinsights-web </span>

  @microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js

import { ApplicationInsights }

from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-web';

import { ReactPlugin }

from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js';

const reactPlugin = new ReactPlugin();

const appInsights =

  new ApplicationInsights({

    config: {

      connectionString: process.env.REACT_APP_AI,

      extensions: [reactPlugin],

      enableAutoRouteTracking: true

    }

  });

appInsights.loadAppInsights();

The React plugin supports route tracking and React-specific telemetry collection. [[learn.microsoft.com]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/javascript-framework-extensions), [[npmjs.com]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-js)

---

## 2\. Let Application Insights Auto-Track Dependencies

Application Insights JavaScript SDK automatically collects AJAX/XHR dependencies and records:

API URL

Duration

Success/Failure

Response Code

Trace Context

For most HTTP requests:

fetch('/api/users');

axios.get('/api/users');

No custom tracking is required. Dependency telemetry is automatically collected and correlated. [[learn.microsoft.com]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/dependencies), [[github.com]](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-node.js/issues/1333)

---

## 3\. Track Business-Critical Dependencies

Not every API is equally important.

Example:

appInsights.trackEvent({

  name: 'CheckoutStarted'

});

Track:

Payment API

Order API

Customer API

Fraud API

This helps correlate technical failures with business impact.

---

## 4\. Monitor Dependency Failures

Create dashboards around:

Top Slow APIs

Top Failed APIs

P95 Latency

P99 Latency

Dependency Failure Rate

Application Insights provides dependency duration and failure telemetry that can be analysed through Application Map and transaction diagnostics. [[learn.microsoft.com]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/dependencies)

---

## 5\. Capture User Context

appInsights.setAuthenticatedUserContext(

  userId

);

This allows correlation of:

User

Session

Page View

API Calls

Exceptions

---

## 6\. Use OpenTelemetry Where Possible

Internal observability guidance recommends OpenTelemetry as the standard mechanism for telemetry generation and distributed tracing. [[OpenTeleme...or buildin | Viva Engage]](https://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/threads/eyJfdHlwZSI6IlRocmVhZCIsImlkIjoiMzI3MjU2MDU4MTc1NDg4MCJ9), [[Persistent...ervability | PowerPoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/EIS-SE-UserExperience/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BDC5B4B45-78EA-4491-80A6-3942D2D19CA6%7D&file=Persistent%20Systems%20to%20Splunk%20-%20Capabilities_Observability.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), [[Persistent...troduction | PDF]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/EIS-SE-UserExperience/EPESGodwon/ReferenceProposals/Shell/Persistent_Shell_Introduction.pdf?web=1)

# Correlation ID Implementation (Frontend + Backend)

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Imagine:

User clicks "Pay Now"

Request flow:

React

↓

API Gateway

↓

Order Service

↓

Payment Service

↓

Redis

↓

Database

Without a Correlation ID:

Thousands of logs

No way to connect them

With a Correlation ID:

CORR-abc123

Every service writes:

[CORR-abc123]

allowing end-to-end traceability.

Distributed tracing and trace correlation are core observability patterns highlighted throughout internal observability materials. [[Stitching...y -- Part 3 | SharePoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/SitePages/Stitching-Events-into-Traces-for-Observability-%e2%80%93-Part-3.aspx?web=1), [[Persistent...y response | PowerPoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/EIS-SE-UserExperience/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB8DC8BD6-2E26-4528-8827-3F3E032A1303%7D&file=Persistent%20Metamo%20API%20gateway%20response.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), [[Netskope-P...e_Jan 2025 | PowerPoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/EIS-SE-UserExperience/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8DD4B758-3F20-4049-98C5-0D940FA15C88%7D&file=Netskope-Persistent_Work%20Stream-360%20Degree_Jan%202025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

# Frontend Implementation

Generate correlation ID per user operation.

import { v4 as uuid }

from 'uuid';

const correlationId = uuid();

Example:

axios.get('/api/users', {

  headers: {

    'X-Correlation-ID':

      correlationId

  }

});

---

## Axios Interceptor

axios.interceptors.request.use(

  config => {

    config.headers[

      'X-Correlation-ID'

    ] = crypto.randomUUID();

    return config;

  }

);

Every request now contains:

X-Correlation-ID:

3e6f7c9a-1234

---

# Backend Implementation (Node.js)

## Express Middleware

app.use((req, res, next) => {

  const correlationId =

      req.headers[

       'x-correlation-id'

      ] || crypto.randomUUID();

  req.correlationId =

      correlationId;

  res.setHeader(

      'X-Correlation-ID',

      correlationId

  );

  next();

});

---

## Structured Logging

Internal engineering guidance specifically recommends including correlation IDs in structured logs for distributed tracing. [[Diksha Sha...Evaluation | PDF]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/PersistentLearningandDevelopment/ResponsiveAssets/SLF/SLF%20AI-interview%20reports/HLS-SLF%20AI-interview%20reports/11-Feb/Diksha%20Shaw_00002450_AI_Inteview_Evaluation.pdf?web=1), [[TD_API_Eng...ring_Final | PowerPoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/EIS-SE-UserExperience/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4F6C3508-6380-4200-9858-3BD259717E3B%7D&file=TD_API_Engineering_Final.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

logger.info({

  correlationId:

     req.correlationId,

  message:

     'User login'

});

Output:

{

  "correlationId":

    "3e6f7c9a",

  "message":

    "User login"

}

---

# Cross-Service Propagation

Service A:

axios.post(

'/payment',

payload,

{

   headers: {

     'X-Correlation-ID':

       req.correlationId

   }

}

);

Service B:

const correlationId =

req.headers[

   'x-correlation-id'

];

Now the same ID flows through:

Gateway

API

Microservice

Database

External API

---

# Application Insights + Correlation

Application Insights supports request/dependency correlation and automatically correlates HTTP calls when both frontend and backend are properly instrumented. Microsoft guidance indicates that additional manual context propagation is generally unnecessary when both sides are instrumented with Application Insights SDKs. [[github.com]](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-node.js/issues/1333), [[learn.microsoft.com]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/dependencies)

Architecture:

# Senior Architect Interview Answer

> In React, I use the Application Insights React SDK with automatic dependency tracking for fetch and Axios calls, while capturing custom business events for critical journeys. For distributed systems, I implement correlation IDs and propagate them through headers across all services. On the backend, correlation IDs are logged as structured metadata and included in outgoing service calls. Application Insights then correlates requests, dependencies, and exceptions into a single trace, enabling rapid root-cause analysis and end-to-end observability. [[learn.microsoft.com]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/dependencies), [[learn.microsoft.com]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/javascript-framework-extensions), [[github.com]](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-node.js/issues/1333), [[TD_API_Eng...ring_Final | PowerPoint]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/EIS-SE-UserExperience/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4F6C3508-6380-4200-9858-3BD259717E3B%7D&file=TD_API_Engineering_Final.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

# 1\. Best Practices for Handling Correlation IDs in Microservices

Correlation IDs enable end-to-end request tracing across gateways, APIs, queues, databases, and external services. Internal observability guidance and distributed tracing materials emphasise correlation IDs as a key mechanism for correlating logs, metrics, and traces and for distributed tracing across services.

## Recommended Practices

### Generate at the Edge

Generate the Correlation ID only once:

Browser

    ↓

API Gateway

    ↓

Microservices

The gateway should:

- Accept an incoming Correlation ID if present
- Generate one if missing
- Propagate it downstream

Internal interview and architecture material describes gateway-based generation and propagation when external systems do not provide identifiers. [[ Looking f...ewadi)

I | Viva Engage]](<https://engage.cloud.microsoft/main/threads/eyJfdHlwZSI6IlRocmVhZCIsImlkIjoiMzg5NDIyNDI3ODcwODIyNCJ9>)

---

### Propagate Everywhere

Pass the same ID through:

HTTP Headers

Message Queues

Events

Background Jobs

Example:

X-Correlation-ID: 4f9a32ec

This allows a single transaction to be reconstructed across multiple systems.

---

### Include in Structured Logs

{

  "correlationId":"4f9a32ec",

  "service":"payment-service",

  "message":"Payment initiated"

}

Internal engineering guidelines explicitly recommend including correlation IDs in all log entries for distributed tracing. [[React Fron..._5.1_grade | PDF]](https://persistentsystems.sharepoint.com/sites/MyLifeAtPersistent731/Shared%20Documents/General/React%20Frontend%20Developer_Gunjan%20Yadav_5.1_grade.pdf?web=1)

### Correlate Logs + Metrics + Traces

Avoid treating them separately.

Metrics

Unified observability platforms should correlate all three telemetry types for faster root-cause analysis.

### Use OpenTelemetry Trace Context

Where possible use:

traceparent

tracestate

OpenTelemetry is repeatedly referenced internally as the preferred standard for telemetry and distributed tracing.

# 2\. How to Visualise API Latency Dashboards Effectively

A common mistake is showing only average response time.

## Dashboard Layout

### Service Overview

Requests/sec

P50

P95

P99

Error %

Availability

Observability guidance highlights latency, traffic, errors, and service health as key monitoring signals.

---

### Use Multiple Percentiles

| Metric | Purpose                  |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| P50    | Typical user experience  |
| P95    | Majority user experience |
| P99    | Worst-case experience    |

Example:

P50 = 100ms

P95 = 800ms

P99 = 4 sec

The average may appear healthy while a small percentage of users experience severe slowness.

---

### Top Slow APIs Widget

GET /users      2.1s

POST /payment   1.8s

GET /orders     1.5s

Sort by:

P95 latency

P99 latency

rather than average latency.

---

### Dependency Breakdown

Show latency split:

Frontend      80ms

Gateway       20ms

API          300ms

Database     900ms

Dependency tracking and tracing capabilities are specifically supported by Application Insights and modern observability platforms.

---

### Heatmaps

Visualise:

Time of Day

vs

Response Time

Helps identify:

- Traffic spikes
- Deployment impact
- Regional issues

---

### Correlation View

Allow engineers to drill into:

Exact Logs

This aligns with observability recommendations to correlate metrics, logs, and traces.

# 3\. Error-Rate Monitoring and Alerting Strategy

## Track Error Rate as a Percentage

Formula:

Error Rate =

Failed Requests /

Total Requests × 100

Example:

100,000 requests

2,000 failures

Error Rate = 2%

---

## Monitor by Service

Bad:

Global Error Rate

Better:

Auth Service

Payments

Orders

Inventory

Notifications

This immediately identifies the failing component.

---

## Separate Errors by Type

Track:

4xx Errors

5xx Errors

Timeouts

Dependency Failures

Network Errors

Observability material highlights dependency monitoring, tracing, platform health, and failure monitoring.

---

## Configure Multi-Level Alerts

### Warning

Error Rate > 1%

for 5 minutes

### Critical

Error Rate > 5%

for 5 minutes

### Emergency

Error Rate > 10%

Internal monitoring guidance includes threshold-based alerts for latency and error conditions.

---

## Alert on Error Budget Burn

Instead of only checking errors:

SLO = 99.9%

Monitor how quickly the service is consuming its error budget.

Benefits:

- Fewer false alarms
- Better alignment with business impact

---

## Correlate Alerts with Traces

When an alert fires:

High Error Rate

     ↓

View Trace

     ↓

View Correlation ID

     ↓

Find Exact Failure

This significantly reduces Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) and is consistent with the observability emphasis on trace correlation and root-cause analysis.

# Staff Engineer / Architect Interview Answer

> In large-scale microservice systems, I generate correlation IDs at the gateway, propagate them across all synchronous and asynchronous calls, and include them in structured logs. For latency monitoring, I focus on P50, P95, and P99 dashboards, dependency breakdowns, and distributed traces rather than averages. For reliability, I monitor service-specific error rates, dependency failures, and SLO-based alerting. By correlating alerts, traces, logs, and metrics through a single correlation ID, production issues can be diagnosed and resolved much faster.
