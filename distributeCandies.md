The task at hand is to help Alice, who has `n` candies, where `n` is always even, and the candies are of different types (represented in the `candyType` array). Alice can eat a maximum of `n / 2` candies, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies. Our goal is to determine the maximum number of unique candy types Alice can consume.

### Problem Breakdown

- Alice can eat at most `n / 2` candies.
- Each candy in the `candyType` array represents a type of candy.
- Alice wants to eat as many different types of candies as possible, but no more than `n / 2` candies.

### Solution Approach

1. **Unique Candy Types**:
   - The first step is to identify how many unique candy types Alice has. This can be done using a `Set`, as it automatically filters out duplicates.
   
2. **Maximum Candies Alice Can Eat**:
   - Alice can eat up to `n / 2` candies. However, if she has fewer than `n / 2` unique types of candies, she can only eat as many as there are unique types.
   
3. **Return the Result**:
   - The result will be the smaller value between the number of unique types and `n / 2`.

### Solution Code

Here’s the implementation of the `distributeCandies` function in JavaScript, using ESM (ECMAScript Module) import/export syntax:

#### `distributeCandies.js`

```js
export function distributeCandies(candyType) {
  const maxCandies = candyType.length / 2;  // Alice can eat at most n / 2 candies
  const uniqueCandies = new Set(candyType);  // Set to get unique candy types

  return Math.min(maxCandies, uniqueCandies.size);  // Return the minimum of n / 2 or the number of unique types
}
```

#### `main.js`

```js
import { distributeCandies } from "./distributeCandies.js";  // Import the function

// Example test cases

const candyType1 = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3];
console.log(distributeCandies(candyType1));  // Output: 3

const candyType2 = [1, 1, 2, 3];
console.log(distributeCandies(candyType2));  // Output: 2

const candyType3 = [6, 6, 6, 6];
console.log(distributeCandies(candyType3));  // Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **`distributeCandies` function**:
  - We calculate `maxCandies` as `candyType.length / 2`. This is the maximum number of candies Alice can eat.
  - We create a `Set` from `candyType`, which gives us the unique candy types.
  - We return the smaller of `maxCandies` (the number of candies Alice can eat) and the size of the `Set` (the number of unique candy types).
  
- **`main.js`**:
  - We import the `distributeCandies` function.
  - Then, we test the function with three different arrays:
    - In the first case, Alice can eat 3 candies, and there are 3 unique types, so the output is 3.
    - In the second case, Alice can eat 2 candies, and there are 3 unique types, but she can only eat 2, so the output is 2.
    - In the third case, Alice can eat 2 candies, but there is only 1 unique type, so the output is 1.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the `candyType` array. This is because we need to iterate through the entire array to build the `Set` of unique types, and the size of the `Set` is computed in constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) because we use a `Set` to store the unique candy types.

### Example Walkthrough

1. **Test Case 1**: `candyType = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
   - `maxCandies = 6 / 2 = 3`
   - `uniqueCandies = Set([1, 2, 3])` (3 unique types)
   - Result: `Math.min(3, 3) = 3`

2. **Test Case 2**: `candyType = [1, 1, 2, 3]`
   - `maxCandies = 4 / 2 = 2`
   - `uniqueCandies = Set([1, 2, 3])` (3 unique types)
   - Result: `Math.min(2, 3) = 2`

3. **Test Case 3**: `candyType = [6, 6, 6, 6]`
   - `maxCandies = 4 / 2 = 2`
   - `uniqueCandies = Set([6])` (1 unique type)
   - Result: `Math.min(2, 1) = 1`

### Conclusion

This solution provides an efficient way to determine the maximum number of different candy types Alice can eat while following the constraint of eating no more than half of her candies. The code is modular and works well with ESM syntax for modern JavaScript development.
