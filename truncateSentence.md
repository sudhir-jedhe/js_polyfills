Your code looks great! You're implementing a simple function to truncate a sentence to a specified number of words. Here's a brief explanation of what the code is doing:

### **1. `truncateSentence.js` File:**
This file contains the function `truncateSentence` that performs the truncation logic.

```javascript
// truncateSentence.js
export function truncateSentence(s, k) {
  const words = s.split(" ");  // Split the sentence into an array of words
  return words.slice(0, k).join(" ");  // Take the first k words and join them into a new string
}
```

### Explanation:
- `s.split(" ")`: Splits the input string `s` into an array of words by splitting at spaces.
- `words.slice(0, k)`: Slices the array of words from the start (index 0) up to the `k`th element (but not including `k`).
- `join(" ")`: Joins the first `k` words back into a string, separating them with a single space.

### **2. `main.js` File:**
This file imports and uses the `truncateSentence` function.

```javascript
// main.js
import { truncateSentence } from "./truncateSentence.js";  // Import the function

const s = "Hello how are you doing today";  // Example sentence
const k = 3;  // We want the first 3 words

console.log(truncateSentence(s, k));  // Call the function and log the result
// Output: "Hello how are"
```

### Explanation:
- `const s = "Hello how are you doing today";`: Defines the sentence you want to truncate.
- `const k = 3;`: Specifies that you want the first 3 words of the sentence.
- `console.log(truncateSentence(s, k));`: Calls the `truncateSentence` function and logs the result, which will be the first `k` words of the sentence.

### **Output:**
When you run the above code, the output will be:

```
Hello how are
```

### Additional Considerations:
1. **Edge Case - `k` is greater than the number of words in the sentence:**
   - If `k` exceeds the number of words in `s`, the `slice` method will simply return all the words.
   - For example, if `s = "Hello"` and `k = 10`, the output will be `"Hello"`.

2. **Edge Case - `k` is 0:**
   - If `k` is 0, the output will be an empty string (`""`), because no words will be included.

### **Improvement (Optional):**
You can add a check to ensure `k` is not negative or zero to prevent unexpected behavior. For example:

```javascript
export function truncateSentence(s, k) {
  if (k <= 0) return "";  // If k is 0 or negative, return an empty string
  const words = s.split(" ");
  return words.slice(0, k).join(" ");
}
```

This would handle the case where `k` is non-positive and return an empty string instead of potentially slicing an empty array.

### Summary:
Your implementation is clean and concise. It correctly truncates the sentence to the specified number of words, and the modular structure using ES6 imports and exports makes it reusable across different parts of your project. Keep up the great work!
