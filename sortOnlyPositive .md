There is a small issue in your code that is causing it to not function as expected. The issue lies in this line:

```javascript
sorted.push(temp[j++]);
```

The variable `temp` is not defined anywhere in the code, which should be `filtered` instead, since the sorted positive numbers are stored in `filtered`. So, the correct line should be:

```javascript
sorted.push(filtered[j++]);
```

With that change, the code will work as intended.

Here is the corrected version:

### **Corrected Code**:

```javascript
let sortOnlyPositive = (arr) => {
  // Filter the positive numbers from the array and sort them
  let filtered = arr.filter(e => e > 0).sort((a, b) => a - b);  // Ensure it's sorted numerically

  // Temp array to hold the sorted array
  let sorted = [];

  // To keep track of the positive sorted array list
  let j = 0;

  // Replace the positive numbers with sorted numbers
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // If the number is positive, replace it with the first number from filtered
    if (arr[i] > 0) {
      sorted.push(filtered[j++]);
    } else {
      // Else push the negative number at the same place
      sorted.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }

  // Return the sorted array
  return sorted;
};

// Test cases
console.log(sortOnlyPositive([2, -6, -3, -8, 4, 1])); // Output: [1, -6, -3, -8, 2, 4]
console.log(sortOnlyPositive([9, -2, 3, -1, 1, 5]));  // Output: [1, -2, 3, -1, 5, 9]
```

### **Explanation of the Changes**:

1. **Sorting the Filtered Array**: The sorted array `filtered` now uses the `.sort((a, b) => a - b)` to ensure numerical sorting (since `.sort()` by default sorts elements as strings).

2. **Replaced `temp` with `filtered`**: The variable `temp` was undefined, so it was replaced with `filtered`, which holds the sorted positive values.

### **Output for Test Cases**:

- For `[2, -6, -3, -8, 4, 1]`, the output is:
  ```javascript
  [1, -6, -3, -8, 2, 4]
  ```

- For `[9, -2, 3, -1, 1, 5]`, the output is:
  ```javascript
  [1, -2, 3, -1, 5, 9]
  ```

The code now correctly sorts only the positive numbers and retains the positions of the negative numbers.
