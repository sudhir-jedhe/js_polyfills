Your code is almost perfect. Here's a breakdown of the logic, followed by a brief explanation of how it works:

### `heightChecker.js`
- **Function**: The function `heightChecker` takes an array of heights and checks how many students are out of order compared to their expected order (sorted in non-decreasing order).
- **Steps**:
  1. **Clone and Sort**: It clones the original `heights` array to avoid mutating the input, then sorts it to get the `expectedHeights` array.
  2. **Mismatch Counting**: It compares each element in the `heights` array with the corresponding element in the `expectedHeights` array. If they differ, it increments the `mismatches` counter.
  
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)` time, and the comparison loop runs in `O(n)` time. So the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

### `main.js`
- **Imports and Calls**: You import the `heightChecker` function and then test it with two sample input arrays: `heights1` and `heights2`. The expected outputs are correctly mentioned in the comments.

### The Code:

#### `heightChecker.js`

```javascript
export function heightChecker(heights) {
  // Clone the heights array and sort it in non-decreasing order
  const expectedHeights = [...heights].sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Compare each height with the corresponding expected height
  let mismatches = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
    if (heights[i] !== expectedHeights[i]) {
      mismatches++;
    }
  }

  return mismatches;
}
```

#### `main.js`

```javascript
import { heightChecker } from "./heightChecker.js";

const heights1 = [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3]; // Expected: 3
const heights2 = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]; // Expected: 5

console.log(heightChecker(heights1)); // Output: 3
console.log(heightChecker(heights2)); // Output: 5
```

### Explanation of Sample Outputs:
- **First Test (`heights1 = [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3]`)**:
  - The sorted array `expectedHeights` is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - Comparing it to the original array `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3]`:
    - Positions 2, 3, and 4 have mismatches (`4` vs `1`, `2` vs `3`, and `1` vs `4`).
  - Hence, there are 3 mismatches, so the output is `3`.

- **Second Test (`heights2 = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`)**:
  - The sorted array `expectedHeights` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
  - Comparing it to the original array `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`:
    - All the positions are mismatched.
  - Hence, there are 5 mismatches, so the output is `5`.

### Running the Code:
If you are running this code in a module-based environment (such as a browser that supports ES Modules, or Node.js with ES Module support), this will work fine.

- **Output**:
  ```
  3
  5
  ```
