These confessions from an engineering manager with over 12 years of experience in startups and MNCs offer valuable insights for anyone in the software engineering field, whether you're just starting out or you've been in the industry for years. Here's a breakdown of these points, and why they are so important:

### 1. **The Best Interviews Were Where I Was Rejected**
   - **Reflection and Growth**: Rejection can be painful, but it’s often the most constructive feedback you’ll receive. Rejection helps you understand your weaknesses and areas for improvement. If you can use feedback constructively, it becomes one of the most powerful growth tools.
   - **Realizing your "level"**: Being rejected shows you where you stand in comparison to others, and that’s often a crucial step toward growth. Embrace it, learn, and improve.

### 2. **Consistency Beats Short Bursts of Motivation**
   - **Sustainable Growth**: Consistency over time compounds into expertise. Motivation can come and go, but consistent effort—even when it's small—is what sets apart those who excel from those who burn out after a quick burst of energy.
   - **Engineering Excellence**: Great engineers show up every day, refine their skills, and keep delivering. Don’t wait for the "perfect moment" to start doing great work.

### 3. **Soft Skills Matter as Much as Technical Skills**
   - **Teamwork**: Technical excellence is important, but if you can’t collaborate effectively, communicate well, and manage conflicts, you’ll hit a ceiling in your career. Building rapport with colleagues, stakeholders, and leadership is often just as crucial as knowing your codebase.
   - **Interpersonal Relationships**: Being liked and respected by your peers is a huge part of career advancement. Engineering is as much about collaboration as it is about code.

### 4. **Low Salary Today Doesn’t Mean Low Salary Forever**
   - **Long-term Vision**: Early in your career, the salary might not reflect your potential. Build your skills, gain experience, and when you’re ready, you can switch to higher-paying opportunities.
   - **Investment in Yourself**: Your value as an engineer grows exponentially as you gain more experience and take on more responsibilities. Patience is key.

### 5. **Don’t Chase Hype-Driven Tech Stacks**
   - **Master the Fundamentals**: Technologies come and go, but core software engineering principles like problem-solving, clean code, and system design remain constant. Focus on mastering these basics and learning how to apply them, and you’ll be equipped for whatever new tech comes next.
   - **Adaptability**: The right fundamentals allow you to quickly adapt to new tools and frameworks as they emerge.

### 6. **Great Engineers Care About *Why* They Build It**
   - **Business Impact**: Understanding the "why" behind the code you’re writing is crucial. When you understand the business context, you can write better, more impactful solutions. This leads to higher quality code, more innovative ideas, and more opportunities for advancement.
   - **Purpose-Driven Work**: When you can tie your work back to business outcomes or customer value, it’s not just about solving technical problems—it's about contributing meaningfully.

### 7. **Management Isn’t a Promotion, It’s a Career Change**
   - **Know Your Path**: Moving into management can be a fulfilling career, but it’s different from being a software engineer. It involves people management, strategic thinking, and leadership skills that may not align with your passion for solving technical problems. Don’t move into management because it’s seen as the "next step"; choose it if that’s where your interest lies.
   - **Two Valuable Paths**: Both engineering and management are valuable career tracks. Recognize that it's not a promotion, but a shift in responsibility.

### 8. **Imposter Syndrome Never Fully Disappears**
   - **Embrace Growth**: Almost every engineer, no matter their level, experiences imposter syndrome. It’s a sign that you’re growing and pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. Rather than viewing it as a negative feeling, see it as an indication that you’re constantly learning.
   - **It’s Normal**: You’re not alone in feeling like you don’t belong sometimes. Even the most experienced engineers have moments of doubt.

### 9. **The Loudest Person Isn’t Always the Smartest**
   - **Quality Over Quantity**: It’s easy to get distracted by the loudest voice in the room, but it’s more important to listen carefully and speak with thoughtfulness. The best ideas often come from the most considered and quiet contributions.
   - **Being Thoughtful**: Being able to listen and add value to the conversation when you do speak is a sign of maturity and expertise.

### 10. **Success is About Knowing How to Learn and Adapt**
   - **Learning Ability**: Technology evolves quickly, and success in engineering is often less about what you know now and more about your ability to learn new things. The best engineers don’t just rely on their current knowledge—they know how to seek out answers, adapt, and grow.
   - **Resilience**: Success is also about how you deal with challenges and obstacles. A growth mindset and curiosity are essential.

### 11. **Your Network Can Change Your Career**
   - **Relationships Matter**: The best opportunities don’t always come from job boards. They often come from personal connections, mentors, and colleagues. Treat people well, build genuine relationships, and help others along the way. A strong network can open doors when you least expect it.
   - **Give and Take**: Be generous with your time and help others—what goes around, comes around.

### 12. **You’ll Remember the People, Not the Projects**
   - **Team Building**: The most fulfilling part of your career will likely be the relationships you build with your colleagues. Focus on being a good team player, and cherish the friendships you create along the way. It’s the people you work with who will have the greatest impact on your career and life.
   - **Culture Over Code**: Projects can come and go, but the teams you work with will stick with you. Invest in building great teams and healthy work cultures.

### Final Thoughts:
These confessions provide a holistic view of what it takes to be a successful engineer, both technically and personally. They remind us that while coding skills are critical, the people you work with, your ability to learn, and your soft skills play just as important a role in shaping your career. If you focus on the fundamentals, foster strong relationships, and keep improving, you’ll set yourself up for long-term success in the industry.
