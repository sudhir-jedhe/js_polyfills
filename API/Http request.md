*** copy Http request.md ***

An **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Request** is a message sent by a client (such as a web browser, mobile app, or backend service) to a server across the internet or a local network. It is the foundational mechanism used to request web pages, fetch data from APIs, submit forms, and perform server mutations.

## 1. Anatomy of an HTTP Request

A complete HTTP request consists of three primary parts: **Request Line**, **Headers**, and an optional **Body**.

### A. The Request Line (First Line)

Defines the HTTP method, the target resource path, and the HTTP protocol version.

* **Format:** `METHOD /path/to/resource HTTP/Version`
* **Example:** `POST /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1`

### B. HTTP Headers (Metadata)

Key-value pairs that provide essential context to the server about what the client wants, how it expects the response, authentication credentials, and data formatting.

* **Example Headers:**
* `Host: api.example.com` (Target server domain)
* `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...` (Client authentication)
* `Content-Type: application/json` (Format of the request body)
* `Accept: application/json` (Desired response format)

### C. Request Body / Payload (Optional)

The data sent along with the request. `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` requests typically do not have a body, whereas `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests carry data (like JSON or form-data) inside the body.

## 2. What an HTTP Request Looks Like on the Wire

If you inspected a raw TCP packet or text transmission of an HTTP request, it looks like this:

```http
POST /api/v1/posts HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 42
Authorization: Bearer token_abc123

## 3. The Client-Server Request Lifecycle

When you trigger an HTTP request (via `fetch`, `axios`, or a browser navigation), the following sequence occurs under the hood:

1. **DNS Lookup:** The browser translates the domain name (e.g., `api.example.com`) into an IP address using DNS.
2. **TCP Connection (Three-Way Handshake):** The client establishes a reliable TCP connection with the server.
3. **TLS / SSL Handshake:** If the connection is secure (`https://`), encryption keys and certificates are negotiated.
4. **Sending the Request:** The client sends the formatted HTTP Request over the connection.
5. **Server Processing:** The server parses the request line, reads headers, validates authentication, executes business logic (e.g., queries a database), and prepares a response.
6. **HTTP Response:** The server sends back an **HTTP Response** containing a Status Code (e.g., `200 OK`, `201 Created`, `404 Not Found`), response headers, and response data.
7. **Connection Closure / Keep-Alive:** The connection is either closed or kept open for subsequent requests depending on the `Connection` header.

An **HTTP Request** is an application-layer data packet formatted according to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specification. It is sent across a network connection (typically TCP/IP or QUIC) from a client to a server to initiate an action or request a resource.

**Structural Anatomy of an HTTP Request**

An HTTP message consists of four discrete components: the Request Line, Request Headers, an empty separator line, and an optional Message Body.

```http
POST /api/v1/users?source=web HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 48
Accept: application/json

{"name":"Sudhir Jedhe","role":"Lead Architect"}

```

**1. The Request Line (Start Line)**
The initial single line that defines the request intent:

* **HTTP Method:** The operation to perform (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`).
* **Request Target (URI/Path):** The path to the target resource, including any optional query string (`/api/v1/users?source=web`).
* **Protocol Version:** The HTTP version used (`HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2`, or `HTTP/3`).

**2. Request Headers (Metadata Block)**
Colon-separated key-value pairs (`Header-Name: Value`) terminating with carriage return and line feed (`\r\n`). They provide instructions on:

* **Target routing:** `Host` (mandatory in HTTP/1.1).
* **Identity:** `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `User-Agent`.
* **Content formatting:** `Content-Type`, `Accept`, `Content-Encoding`.
* **State & conditional execution:** `If-Match`, `If-None-Match`.

**3. Empty Line (`CRLF`)**
A mandatory blank line (`\r\n`) separating headers from the payload. It signals the end of metadata to the HTTP parser.

**4. Message Body (Payload)**
The actual data stream sent to the server. Omitted in safe operations (`GET`, `HEAD`, `DELETE`), but present in mutations (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`) as JSON, form data, XML, or raw binary streams.

  |<== 6. Receive HTTP Response (Status, Headers, Body) ====|

```

1. **DNS Resolution:** Client translates the hostname into an IP address.
2. **Transport Connection:** Client completes a 3-way TCP handshake (or UDP initialization for HTTP/3).
3. **TLS Negotiation:** Secure channels establish encryption ciphers and exchange certificates over HTTPS.
4. **Packet Serialization & Dispatch:** The client engine formats the start line, headers, and body bytes, sending them over the established socket.
5. **Server Ingestion:** The web server or reverse proxy parses headers, performs auth verification, routes the request to controller logic, and returns a formatted HTTP response.

**Method Semantics & Characteristics**

| Method        | Body Allowed? | Safe? (No State Change) | Idempotent? (Repeats produce identical server state) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **`GET`**     | No            | **Yes**                 | **Yes**                                              |
| **`HEAD`**    | No            | **Yes**                 | **Yes**                                              |
| **`POST`**    | Yes           | No                      | No                                                   |
| **`PUT`**     | Yes           | No                      | **Yes**                                              |
| **`PATCH`**   | Yes           | No                      | Condition-dependent                                  |
| **`DELETE`**  | Optional      | No                      | **Yes**                                              |

**HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2 vs. HTTP/3 Request Mechanics**

* **HTTP/1.1 (Text-Based Streaming):** Plain-text ASCII headers and payloads sent sequentially. Suffers from Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking on single TCP sockets.
* **HTTP/2 (Binary Framing):** Replaces raw text with binary frames. Headers are compressed via **HPACK**. Multiple requests are multiplexed concurrently across a single TCP connection.
* **HTTP/3 (QUIC / UDP-Based):** Operates over QUIC instead of TCP, eliminating transport-level HoL blocking on packet drops and using **QPACK** header compression.
