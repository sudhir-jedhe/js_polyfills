*** copy Idempotency.md ***

**Idempotency** is a core computer science and REST API architectural concept.

An operation is **idempotent** if making multiple identical requests produces the **exact same server state and side effects** as making a single request. No matter how many times you repeat the action, the end result remains unchanged.

## 1. Idempotency Across HTTP Methods

Not all HTTP methods are created equal when it comes to idempotency:

| HTTP Method            | Idempotent? | Why / Explanation                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`GET`**              | **Yes**     | Reading a resource multiple times does not change its data or state.                                                                                                                            |
| **`PUT`**              | **Yes**     | Replacing a resource with a specific payload (`PUT /users/1` with name "Sudhir") results in the exact same state whether sent once or ten times.                                                |
| **`DELETE`**           | **Yes**     | Deleting a resource once removes it. Deleting it again leaves it deleted (subsequent calls might return `404 Not Found` or `204 No Content`, but the core system state doesn't change further). |
| **`HEAD` / `OPTIONS**` | **Yes**     | Read-only metadata operations that do not modify state.                                                                                                                                         |
| **`PATCH`**            | **Depends** | If the patch sets an absolute value (`{"status": "active"}`), it is idempotent. If it performs a relative increment (`{"credits": credits + 1}`), it is **not** idempotent.                     |
| **`POST`**             | **No**      | Each `POST` request is intended to create a *new* unique resource. Sending it twice creates two separate resources (e.g., placing two separate orders).                                         |

## 2. Why Idempotency Matters (The Network Failure Problem)

In real-world distributed systems, networks are unreliable.

* **The Scenario:** A user clicks a "Pay $100" button (`POST /api/payments`). The client sends the request, the server successfully processes the payment, but **the network drops right before the response reaches the client**.
* **The Danger:** Because the client never received a response, it assumes the request failed and automatically **retries** the request. Without idempotency, the user gets charged a second time.

## 3. How to Achieve Idempotency for `POST` Requests (Idempotency Keys)

To make non-idempotent operations like `POST` safe against network retries, APIs use **Idempotency Keys**.

Industry giants like Stripe, PayPal, and modern financial APIs rely heavily on this pattern:

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Client Generates a Unique Key:** Before making a critical `POST` request, the client generates a unique identifier (usually a UUID v4) and sends it in a custom header:

```http
POST /api/v1/payments
Idempotency-Key: 9b1deb4d-3b7d-4bad-9bdd-2b0d7b3dcb6d
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 100.00,
  "currency": "USD"
}

```

1. **Server Checks Cache/Database:** When the server receives the request, it checks if it has already processed a request with `Idempotency-Key: 9b1deb4d-...` within a given time window (e.g., the last 24 hours).
2. **Handling Duplicates:**

* *First time seeing the key:* The server processes the payment, saves the response linked to that key in a fast cache (like Redis), and returns it.
* *If a retry arrives with the same key:* The server recognizes the key, skips processing the payment entirely, and **instantly returns the cached response** from the first attempt.

**API Idempotency** is an architectural pattern ensuring that an API endpoint can be called repeatedly with the same parameters while leaving the server in the exact same state as the initial execution.

**Core HTTP Idempotency Matrix**

| Method             | Idempotent      | Safe (Read-Only) | Behavior on Multiple Calls                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`GET` / `HEAD**` | **Yes**         | **Yes**          | Server state never changes.                                                                                                                            |
| **`OPTIONS`**      | **Yes**         | **Yes**          | Inspects capabilities with zero state mutation.                                                                                                        |
| **`PUT`**          | **Yes**         | No               | Overwrites resource state to a fixed value. Calling it $N$ times results in the same final resource.                                                   |
| **`DELETE`**       | **Yes**         | No               | Removes the resource. The first call returns `200`/`204`, subsequent calls return `404`, but the underlying state (resource absent) remains identical. |
| **`PATCH`**        | **Conditional** | No               | Idempotent for absolute assignments (`{ "status": "active" }`); non-idempotent for relative operations (`{ "balance": "+10" }`).                       |
| **`POST`**         | **No**          | No               | Designed for creation or non-deterministic actions. Resending creates duplicate resources unless handled with idempotency keys.                        |

*Note: Idempotency is defined by the **final server state**, not identical HTTP response codes.*

**The Distributed Systems Failure Problem**

In distributed networks, API calls frequently encounter transient network disconnects, gateway timeouts ($504$), or connection resets:

```
[ Client ] ------------ 1. POST /api/v1/orders ------------> [ Server ]
[ Client ]                                                   [ Server ] (Order created, charged $50)
[ Client ] <........... 2. Network Timeout (Dropped) ........ [ Server ]
[ Client ] ------------ 3. Automatic Retry -----------------> [ Server ] (Without Idempotency -> Charged $100)

```

Without idempotency protections, the client cannot distinguish between a failure *before* server processing and a failure *after* server processing, leading to double billing, duplicate records, or corrupted state.

**Implementation Blueprint: Idempotency Keys**

For non-idempotent methods (`POST` and relative `PATCH`), modern APIs (like Stripe, Adyen, and AWS) use client-generated **Idempotency Keys**.

```

**Production Middleware Pattern (Node.js & Redis)**

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import Redis from 'ioredis';

const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const idempotencyMiddleware = async (req, res, next) => {
  const idempotencyKey = req.headers['idempotency-key'];

  // Skip safe methods or requests without an idempotency key
  if (['GET', 'HEAD', 'OPTIONS'].includes(req.method) || !idempotencyKey) {
    return next();
  }

  const cacheKey = `idempotency:${idempotencyKey}`;

  try {
    // 1. Check existing record
    const cachedRecord = await redis.get(cacheKey);

    if (cachedRecord) {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(cachedRecord);

      if (parsed.status === 'PENDING') {
        // Request is currently executing concurrently
        return res.status(409).json({
          error: 'Concurrent request in progress with the same idempotency key.'
        });
      }

      // 2. Replay previous response
      res.set(parsed.headers);
      return res.status(parsed.statusCode).send(parsed.body);
    }

    // 3. Acquire lock with status: PENDING (TTL: 120s for timeouts)
    const acquired = await redis.set(
      cacheKey,
      JSON.stringify({ status: 'PENDING' }),
      'NX',
      'EX',
      120
    );

    if (!acquired) {
      return res.status(409).json({ error: 'Concurrent request conflict.' });
    }

    // 4. Intercept response to cache final output
    const originalSend = res.send.bind(res);
    res.send = (body) => {
      // Persist completed payload for 24 hours (86400s)
      redis.set(
        cacheKey,
        JSON.stringify({
          status: 'COMPLETED',
          statusCode: res.statusCode,
          headers: { 'Content-Type': res.get('Content-Type') },
          body: body
        }),
        'EX',
        86400
      );

      return originalSend(body);
    };

    next();
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
};

app.post('/api/v1/payments', idempotencyMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // Business logic execution
  res.status(201).json({ success: true, paymentId: 'pay_9921a', amount: req.body.amount });
});

```

**Critical Engineering Guardrails**

* **Payload Validation:** Validate that the request body matches the original request associated with that key. If a client reuses an idempotency key with a *different* body or URL, return a `422 Unprocessable Entity` or `400 Bad Request` mismatch error.
* **Scope Key per Tenant/User:** Always namespace the cache key with the authenticated user ID (`idempotency:{userId}:{key}`) to prevent cross-account key collisions or hijacking.
* **Define Cache TTL:** Retain stored idempotency responses for 24 to 72 hours depending on transaction volume and regulatory requirements.
* **Atomic Locking:** Always use atomic operations (`SET key value NX EX`) to avoid race conditions when two identical requests arrive simultaneously.
