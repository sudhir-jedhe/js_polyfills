*** copy API documentation for developers.md ***

Great API documentation is the cornerstone of exceptional **Developer Experience (DX)**. If an API is powerful but poorly documented, adoption plummets because developers waste hours guessing endpoints, payloads, and authentication rules.

Here is a comprehensive guide to structuring and writing world-class API documentation for developers.

---

## 1. Essential Components of API Documentation

A complete developer portal or documentation page should include the following core sections:

### A. Quickstart / Getting Started

* **What it is:** A 5-minute guide to get developers from zero to their first successful API call.
* **Key elements:** How to get an API key, base URL endpoints, and a simple copy-pasteable `cURL` or JavaScript `fetch` example.

### B. Authentication & Authorization

* **What it is:** Clear instructions on how clients must prove their identity.
* **Key elements:** Explaining API keys, Bearer tokens (JWT), OAuth 2.0 flows, or HMAC signatures, along with where to place them (e.g., in the `Authorization` header).

### C. Endpoints & Reference Manual

* **What it is:** A meticulous breakdown of every available route. For each endpoint, document:
* **HTTP Method & Path:** (e.g., `POST /api/v1/users`)
* **Path & Query Parameters:** Name, type (string, integer), required/optional status, and description.
* **Request Body Schema:** Expected JSON structure with example payloads.
* **Response Body Schema:** Successful response structure (with status codes like `200 OK` or `201 Created`).
* **Error Responses:** Document what failure looks like (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`) and the error JSON format returned.

### D. Code Snippets & SDKs

* Provide multi-language code snippets (cURL, JavaScript/Fetch, Python, Node.js) so developers can test immediately without writing custom parsing code from scratch.

### E. Rate Limiting & Versioning

* Clearly state limits (e.g., "100 requests per minute per API key") and headers returned (`X-RateLimit-Remaining`). Explain your semantic versioning policy (`/v1/`, `/v2/`).

## 2. Industry Standards & Best Practices for DX

* **Design First with OpenAPI (Swagger):** Write your API specification in YAML or JSON using the **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)** standard. This allows you to automatically generate interactive documentation and client SDKs.
* **Provide Interactive Playgrounds:** Developers love "Try It Out" buttons where they can input their test API key and fire live requests directly from the documentation page (tools like Swagger UI, Redoc, or Postman collections enable this).
* **Keep a Changelog:** APIs change. Maintain a public changelog detailing deprecated fields, new endpoints, and breaking changes so client developers aren't caught off guard.
* **Clear Error Messages:** Never return generic `500 Internal Server Error` strings if you can avoid it. Return helpful error objects:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT",
    "message": "The provided email address 'user@domain' is missing a top-level domain.",
    "status": 400
  }
}

```

## 3. Popular Tools for Building API Docs

* **Swagger UI / Redoc:** Open-source tools that render gorgeous, interactive documentation directly from an OpenAPI (`swagger.yaml`) file.
* **Postman:** Excellent for publishing API documentation, testing endpoints, and generating mock servers.
* **Mintlify / ReadMe / Stoplight:** Modern, beautiful, hosted developer portal platforms designed specifically for world-class documentation.

Are you planning to document a REST API, a GraphQL schema, or something else for your project?

Designing and documenting a **REST (Representational State Transfer) API** requires adhering to clean architectural conventions so that consumer developers can intuitively understand, predict, and integrate with your endpoints without constantly consulting support.

Here is a comprehensive guide to **REST API Design & Documentation Best Practices**.

---

## 1. Core REST Architectural Principles

Before writing documentation, your REST API must follow standard RESTful conventions:

* **Resource-Based URLs (Nouns, Not Verbs):** URLs should represent resources (objects/collections), while HTTP methods define the actions performed on them.
* *Good:* `GET /api/v1/users`, `POST /api/v1/users`, `DELETE /api/v1/users/5`
* *Bad:* `GET /api/v1/getUsers`, `POST /api/v1/createUser`

* **Plural Nouns for Collections:** Always use plural nouns for resource collections (`/tasks`, `/articles`, `/products`).
* **Statelessness:** Every request from a client must contain all the information necessary (such as auth tokens) for the server to understand and fulfill it.

## 2. Mapping HTTP Methods to CRUD Operations

Your documentation should clearly map each route to its intended operation:

| HTTP Method  | Action  | Example Endpoint           | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`GET`**    | Read    | `GET /api/v1/tasks`        | Retrieves a list of tasks or a single task (`/tasks/123`). |
| **`POST`**   | Create  | `POST /api/v1/tasks`       | Creates a new task resource.                               |
| **`PUT`**    | Replace | `PUT /api/v1/tasks/123`    | Completely overwrites or upserts task `123`.               |
| **`PATCH`**  | Update  | `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/123`  | Updates specific fields of task `123`.                     |
| **`DELETE`** | Remove  | `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/123` | Deletes task `123`.                                        |

---

## 3. Standardizing HTTP Status Codes

Good REST documentation explicitly states which status codes an endpoint can return. Avoid returning `200 OK` with an error message inside the body. Use proper HTTP semantics:

* **Success Codes:**
* `200 OK`: Standard success for GET, PUT, PATCH.
* `201 Created`: Successfully created a resource (used in POST). Returns the created object and `Location` header.
* `204 No Content`: Successful action with no response body (common for DELETE).

* **Client Error Codes (`4xx`):**
* `400 Bad Request`: Malformed JSON syntax or missing required fields.
* `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication token.
* `403 Forbidden`: Authenticated, but the user lacks permissions for this action.
* `404 Not Found`: The requested resource ID does not exist.
* `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Authentication succeeded, but validation failed (e.g., password too short).

* **Server Error Codes (`5xx`):**
* `500 Internal Server Error`: Unhandled crash, database timeout, or unexpected server fault.

## 4. Anatomy of a Well-Documented REST Endpoint

When documenting an individual REST endpoint in your developer portal, structure it like this template:

### Example Documentation Entry: `POST /api/v1/tasks`

* **Description:** Creates a new task for the authenticated user.
* **Headers:**
* `Authorization` (string, Required): Bearer token.
* `Content-Type` (string, Required): Must be `application/json`.

* **Request Body Schema:**

```json
{
  "title": "string (Required, max 100 chars)",
  "description": "string (Optional)",
  "priority": "string (Optional: 'low', 'medium', 'high')"
}

```

* **Successful Response (`201 Created`):**

```json
{
  "id": "tsk_89f73c",
  "title": "Finish API documentation",
  "description": "Write a guide on REST best practices",
  "priority": "high",
  "completed": false,
  "createdAt": "2026-06-06T15:00:00Z"
}

```

* **Error Response (`400 Bad Request`):**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "MISSING_FIELD",
    "message": "The 'title' field is required."
  }
}

```

## 5. Handling Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination

For `GET` collection endpoints (`GET /api/v1/tasks`), your documentation must explain how clients can query large datasets:

* **Pagination:** Use query parameters like `page` and `limit` (offset-based) or `cursor` and `limit` (cursor-based for infinite scrolling).
* *Example:* `/api/v1/tasks?page=2&limit=20`

* **Filtering:** Allow clients to filter results via query parameters.
* *Example:* `/api/v1/tasks?status=completed&priority=high`

* **Sorting:** Allow field-based sorting (prefixing with `-` for descending order).
* *Example:* `/api/v1/tasks?sort=-createdAt`
