The function `is_touch_enabled()` that you've provided is a way to detect if the user's device supports touch input. This is useful for tailoring the user experience, such as showing touch-friendly elements or adjusting interactions for touch-based devices.

### Explanation of the Code:

```js
function is_touch_enabled() {
  return (
    "ontouchstart" in window ||  // Checks if "ontouchstart" event is supported in the window object
    navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0 ||  // Checks if the device supports touch points
    navigator.msMaxTouchPoints > 0  // Checks for the presence of msMaxTouchPoints for older IE browsers
  );
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **`"ontouchstart" in window`**:
   - This checks if the `ontouchstart` event is available on the `window` object.
   - The `ontouchstart` event is fired when the user touches a touch-enabled element on the screen.
   - If this event handler is available, it generally indicates that the device supports touch events.

2. **`navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0`**:
   - This property is part of the `navigator` object and tells you how many touch points (fingers or stylus) the device can register simultaneously.
   - If this value is greater than `0`, it indicates that the device supports multiple touch points (e.g., 2-finger pinch zoom).
   - This is a more modern and reliable method of detecting touch capability, and it works on newer browsers and devices.

3. **`navigator.msMaxTouchPoints > 0`**:
   - This is the Microsoft vendor-prefixed version of `maxTouchPoints` and is used primarily for older versions of Internet Explorer (IE 10 and earlier), which used to have its own handling for touch detection.
   - If this property is greater than `0`, it indicates that the device supports touch.

### How It Works:

- The function checks for all three of the conditions:
  - If any one of the conditions is true, it returns `true`, indicating that the device supports touch.
  - If none of the conditions are met, it returns `false`, indicating that the device does not support touch.

### Example Usage:

```js
if (is_touch_enabled()) {
  console.log("This device supports touch!");
} else {
  console.log("This device does not support touch.");
}
```

This would print out whether the current device supports touch input or not.

### Why This Method Works:

- **`ontouchstart`**: This was the first event used to detect touch events, and it works in most modern browsers.
- **`maxTouchPoints`**: This property is part of the HTML5 specification and is available in most modern browsers, providing a better way to detect touch support, especially for devices with multiple touch points (e.g., smartphones, tablets).
- **`msMaxTouchPoints`**: Since `msMaxTouchPoints` is specifically for older versions of Internet Explorer (IE 10 and earlier), it's a fallback for legacy browsers.

### Example Devices:

1. **Mobile Devices (Smartphones/Tablets)**:
   - Modern smartphones and tablets (e.g., iPhone, Android phones, iPads) will return `true` for this function because they all support touch.

2. **Laptops (with touch screens)**:
   - Some modern laptops with touch screens (like Windows laptops with touch-sensitive displays) will also return `true`.

3. **Desktop PCs (without touch screens)**:
   - A typical desktop PC with a non-touch monitor will return `false` because the device does not support touch.

### Browser Compatibility:

- This code works well across most modern browsers, including:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  - Edge
- It also handles older versions of Internet Explorer (specifically IE 10) through the `msMaxTouchPoints` property.

### Summary:

- The `is_touch_enabled()` function detects whether a device supports touch input by checking multiple properties and events.
- It handles both modern and legacy touch detection and can be used to tailor interactions depending on whether touch is supported.
