### Explanation of the Code Using the Tab Character (`\t`)

The tab character (`\t`) is used to represent a horizontal tab in regular expressions and strings. This is generally used for formatting text in a structured way, like separating columns in tables or aligning text.

Let's break down the two code examples you provided.

---

### **First Example: Checking for the Tab Character (`\t`) in `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "GeeksforGeeks@_123_$";
  let regex4 = /\t/;  // This regex searches for a tab character
  let match4 = str1.search(regex4);

  if (match4 == -1) {
    console.log("No tab character present. ");
  } else {
    console.log("Index of tab character: " + match4);
  }
}
geek();
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Input String**: `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`
   - The string does not contain any tab characters, so the expectation is that no match should be found.

2. **Regular Expression**: `/\t/`
   - The `\t` regex looks for a **tab character**.
   - Since the string doesn't contain any tab characters, no match is found.

3. **Result**:
   - The `.search()` method returns `-1` if no match is found.
   - The code checks if `match4` is `-1` and, in this case, prints `"No tab character present."`.

4. **Output**:
   ```
   No tab character present.
   ```

### **Second Example: Searching for the Tab Character (`\t`) in `"123ge\teky456"`

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "123ge\teky456";  // String contains a tab character
  let regex4 = new RegExp("\\t");  // Regex to search for the tab character
  let match4 = str1.search(regex4);

  console.log("Index of tab character: " + match4);
}
geek();
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Input String**: `"123ge\teky456"`
   - The string contains a **tab character** (`\t`) between `"ge"` and `"ky"`. This tab character is what we want to search for.

2. **Regular Expression**: `new RegExp("\\t")`
   - The `\\t` in the regular expression represents a tab character (`\t`).
   - The `\\` is necessary because the backslash is an escape character in JavaScript strings, so we need to use `\\` to match a literal backslash followed by `t`.

3. **Result**:
   - The `.search()` method returns the **index** of the first occurrence of the tab character (`\t`).
   - The tab character is located at position `5` in the string `"123ge\teky456"`.
   
4. **Output**:
   ```
   Index of tab character: 5
   ```

### Key Points:
1. **Tab Character (`\t`)**:
   - The tab character is often used for formatting text, especially in console outputs or file structures. In regular expressions, `\t` specifically matches this tab character.
   
2. **`.search()` Method**:
   - The `.search()` method returns the **index of the first match** of the regular expression in the string.
   - If no match is found, it returns `-1`.

3. **Regular Expression**:
   - `/\t/` is used to match the tab character. In JavaScript strings, you need to escape the backslash, so `\\t` is used when constructing the regular expression using `new RegExp()`.

4. **Example Outputs**:
   - **No tab character**: The string `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"` does not contain a tab character, so the output is `"No tab character present."`
   - **Tab character found**: The string `"123ge\teky456"` contains a tab character, and the output is `"Index of tab character: 5"` because the tab is at index 5.

### Summary:

In the first example, the string does not contain any tab characters, so the program outputs that no tab character is present. In the second example, the string contains a tab character, and the program correctly identifies its index as 5.
