In your code snippets, you are testing the use of newline characters (`\n`) in strings and using regular expressions (`RegExp`) to detect the presence of newline characters. Let's go over both functions and explain how they work.

### 1. **Detecting Newline Characters in a String**

#### Function 1: No Newline Present

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "GeeksforGeeks@_123_$";
  let regex4 = /\n/;  // Regular expression to match a newline character.
  let match4 = str1.search(regex4);  // Searching for the newline character.

  if (match4 == -1) {  // If no match is found, index will be -1.
    console.log("No newline characters present. ");
  } else {
    console.log("Index of newline character: " + match4);
  }
}

geek();
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The string `str1` is `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`, and you are checking for the presence of a newline character (`\n`).
  - `search(regex4)` searches for the first match of the regular expression `regex4` (which is looking for `\n`), and it returns the **index of the first match**.
  - If no newline is found, `search` returns `-1`, and the `if` statement logs `"No newline characters present."`.
  - Since there is no newline character in `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`, the output will be:
  
  ```
  No newline characters present.
  ```

#### Function 2: Newline Present in String

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "123ge\neky456";
  let regex4 = new RegExp("\\n");  // Using RegExp constructor to match newline character.
  let match4 = str1.search(regex4);  // Searching for the newline character.

  console.log("Index of newline character: " + match4);  // Logs the index of newline.
}

geek();
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The string `str1` contains the text `"123ge\neky456"`, where `\n` is a newline character between `"123ge"` and `"ky456"`.
  - You are using `new RegExp("\\n")` to create a regular expression for matching a newline character (`\n`).
  - `search(regex4)` will return the index of the first newline character. Since the newline character is at index 6 (just after `"123ge"`), the output will be:

  ```
  Index of newline character: 6
  ```

### Key Differences:

- **First Function**: The string does not contain a newline, so the result is `"No newline characters present."`.
- **Second Function**: The string contains a newline (`\n`), so the output shows the index of the newline character (`6`).

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

- **`search()` Method**:
  - The `search()` method searches for a match between a string and a regular expression.
  - It returns the index of the first match, or `-1` if no match is found.
  - For example, `str1.search(/\n/)` will return the index where the newline character (`\n`) first appears in the string, or `-1` if there's no newline.

- **`RegExp` Constructor**:
  - `new RegExp("\\n")` creates a regular expression that matches the newline character (`\n`).
  - Note that when using the `RegExp` constructor, you need to escape the backslash (`\\n`) because the backslash is a special character in strings. Without escaping, it would be interpreted as a special escape sequence.

### Output Summary:

- **For the first function**: The string has no newline, so it prints:
  ```
  No newline characters present.
  ```
- **For the second function**: The string contains a newline at index 6, so it prints:
  ```
  Index of newline character: 6
  ```

If you want to test this further or modify it for other types of character checks, you can use different regular expressions (e.g., `\r` for carriage return, `\t` for tab characters, etc.).
