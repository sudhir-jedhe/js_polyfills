### **Explanation of the Two Code Snippets:**

#### **Code 1: Matching words starting with "A", followed by any character, and ending with "C"**

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "ABC, A3C, A C, AXXCC!";
  let regex4 = /A.C/g;  // Regular expression to match words starting with "A" and ending with "C" with one character in between
  let match4 = str1.match(regex4);

  console.log("Found " + match4.length + " matches: " + match4);
}
geek();
```

### **Explanation**:
- **`/A.C/g`**:
  - **`A`**: Matches the character `"A"`.
  - **`.`**: Matches **any single character** (except newline characters).
  - **`C`**: Matches the character `"C"`.
  - The **global flag (`g`)** ensures all occurrences in the string are matched.

- **`str1 = "ABC, A3C, A C, AXXCC!"`**:
  - The string contains a few words and characters that could potentially match the pattern:
    - `"ABC"` (matches because it starts with "A" and ends with "C" with exactly one character "B" in between)
    - `"A3C"` (matches because it starts with "A" and ends with "C" with exactly one character "3" in between)
    - `"A C"` (matches because it starts with "A" and ends with "C" with exactly one character " " (space) in between)
    - `"AXXCC!"` (does not match because the pattern specifies only one character between "A" and "C", but there are more characters in between here)

- **`match()`**: This method is used to find all occurrences that match the pattern and return them as an array.
  - The result is: `["ABC", "A3C", "A C"]`.

### **Output**:
```javascript
Found 3 matches: ABC,A3C,A C
```

#### **Code 2: Matching words starting with "a", followed by any character, and ending with "c"**

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "ABC, A3X, a x, AXXCC!";
  let regex4 = new RegExp("a.x", "g");  // Regular expression to match words starting with "a" and ending with "c" with one character in between
  let match4 = str1.match(regex4);

  console.log("Found " + match4.length + " matches: " + match4);
}
geek();
```

### **Explanation**:
- **`new RegExp("a.x", "g")`**:
  - **`a`**: Matches the lowercase letter `"a"`.
  - **`.`**: Matches any **single character** (except newline characters).
  - **`x`**: Matches the lowercase letter `"x"`.
  - The **global flag (`g`)** ensures all occurrences in the string are matched.

- **`str1 = "ABC, A3X, a x, AXXCC!"`**:
  - The string contains:
    - `"ABC"` (does not match because it starts with `"A"`, but we are looking for lowercase `"a"`)
    - `"A3X"` (does not match because it starts with `"A"`, but we are looking for lowercase `"a"`)
    - `"a x"` (matches because it starts with `"a"`, has one character `" "` (space) in between, and ends with `"x"`)
    - `"AXXCC!"` (does not match because we are looking for `"a"` at the start and `"x"` at the end, but `"AXXCC!"` does not follow this pattern)

- **`match()`**: This method is used to find all occurrences that match the pattern and return them as an array.
  - The result is: `["a x"]`.

### **Output**:
```javascript
Found 1 match: a x
```

### **Key Differences**:
1. **Character Case Sensitivity**:  
   - The first code snippet is case-sensitive and looks for words that start with the uppercase letter `"A"` and end with the uppercase letter `"C"`.
   - The second code snippet looks for words that start with the lowercase letter `"a"` and end with the lowercase letter `"c"`.
   
2. **Patterns**:
   - **First snippet**: Uses `/A.C/g` to match any character between `"A"` and `"C"`.
   - **Second snippet**: Uses `"a.x"` to match any character between `"a"` and `"x"`. This snippet also only matches one instance of the letter `"x"`, which can be misleading if you expect to find other similar patterns with different characters.

---

### **Summary**:
- **Pattern Explanation**: 
  - **`/A.C/g`**: Matches words starting with `"A"`, followed by any character, and ending with `"C"`.
  - **`"a.x"`**: Matches words starting with `"a"`, followed by any character, and ending with `"x"`.
  
- **Test Results**: 
  - The first function finds 3 matches: `"ABC"`, `"A3C"`, `"A C"`.
  - The second function finds 1 match: `"a x"`. 

This shows how regular expressions can be used to match specific patterns and how slight differences in pattern can significantly change the matches found.
