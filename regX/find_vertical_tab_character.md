### Explanation of the Code Using the Vertical Tab Character (`\v`)

The **vertical tab character** (`\v`) is an ASCII control character, typically used to align text vertically or to create some spacing between lines. In regular expressions, `\v` is used to match this character.

Let's break down the two examples you provided.

---

### **First Example: Checking for the Vertical Tab Character (`\v`) in `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "GeeksforGeeks@_123_$";
  let regex4 = /\v/;  // This regex searches for a vertical tab character
  let match4 = str1.search(regex4);

  if (match4 == -1) {
    console.log("No vertical tab character present. ");
  } else {
    console.log("Index of vertical tab character: " + match4);
  }
}
geek();
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Input String**: `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`
   - The string does **not contain any vertical tab characters**.
   
2. **Regular Expression**: `/\v/`
   - The `\v` in the regular expression matches a **vertical tab character**.
   - Since the input string doesn't contain any vertical tab characters, the `.search()` method will return `-1` (no match).

3. **Result**:
   - The `.search()` method will return `-1` because there is no match for the vertical tab.
   - The code checks if `match4` is `-1` and prints `"No vertical tab character present."`.

4. **Output**:
   ```
   No vertical tab character present.
   ```

### **Second Example: Searching for the Vertical Tab Character (`\v`) in `"123ge\veky456"`

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "123ge\veky456";  // String contains a vertical tab character
  let regex4 = new RegExp("\\v");  // Regex to search for the vertical tab character
  let match4 = str1.search(regex4);

  console.log("Index of vertical tab character: " + match4);
}
geek();
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Input String**: `"123ge\veky456"`
   - The string contains a **vertical tab character** (`\v`) between `"ge"` and `"ky"`. This is the character we want to search for.

2. **Regular Expression**: `new RegExp("\\v")`
   - The `\\v` in the regular expression represents a vertical tab character (`\v`).
   - The `\\` is used because backslashes are escape characters in JavaScript strings, so `\\v` is used to match the vertical tab.

3. **Result**:
   - The `.search()` method returns the **index** of the first occurrence of the vertical tab character (`\v`).
   - The vertical tab character is located at index `5` in the string `"123ge\veky456"`.

4. **Output**:
   ```
   Index of vertical tab character: 5
   ```

### Key Points:
1. **Vertical Tab Character (`\v`)**:
   - The vertical tab character is not widely used in modern text formatting, but it exists as part of the ASCII control characters.
   - It is typically used for vertical alignment, but it’s not as common as other formatting characters such as spaces, tabs (`\t`), or newlines (`\n`).

2. **`.search()` Method**:
   - The `.search()` method in JavaScript returns the index of the first match of the regular expression in the string.
   - If no match is found, it returns `-1`.

3. **Regular Expression**:
   - `/\v/` searches for the vertical tab character (`\v`).
   - If you are using `new RegExp()`, you need to escape the backslash (`\\v`).

4. **Example Outputs**:
   - **No vertical tab character**: In the string `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`, there are no vertical tab characters, so the output is `"No vertical tab character present."`
   - **Vertical tab character found**: In the string `"123ge\veky456"`, the vertical tab character is found at index `5`, and the output is `"Index of vertical tab character: 5"`.

### Summary:

In the first example, the string `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"` does not contain a vertical tab character, so the code outputs that no vertical tab character is present. In the second example, the string `"123ge\veky456"` contains a vertical tab character, and the program correctly identifies its index as 5.
