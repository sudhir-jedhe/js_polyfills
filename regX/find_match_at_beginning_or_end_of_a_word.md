Let's go through both examples in detail, where you're using the regular expression boundary `\b` to match specific words and replace them.

---

### Example 1: Matching the Word "GeeksforGeeks"

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "GeeksforGeeks@_123_$";
  let regex4 = /\bgeeksforgeeks/gi;  // Regular expression to match the word 'GeeksforGeeks'
  let match4 = str1.match(regex4);   // Using match() to find the pattern

  console.log("Found " + match4.length + " match: " + match4); // Logging the result
}
geek();
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Regular Expression**: `/\bgeeksforgeeks/gi`
   - `\b`: This is a **word boundary** anchor. It matches the position between a word character (like letters, digits, etc.) and a non-word character (like spaces, punctuation, or the beginning/end of the string).
   - `geeksforgeeks`: The literal word we're looking for.
   - `g`: This is the **global** flag. It ensures that the match is applied across the entire string, not just the first occurrence.
   - `i`: This is the **case-insensitive** flag. It ensures that both "GeeksforGeeks" and "geeksforgeeks" (or any case variation) are matched.

2. **`match()`**: This method finds all substrings in `str1` that match the regular expression. It returns an array of matches.

3. **Input String**: `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`
   - The regular expression `/\bgeeksforgeeks/gi` matches the word `"GeeksforGeeks"` at the **start** of the string. The word boundary `\b` ensures that it only matches complete words and not substrings inside other words.

4. **Output**:
   - The result is an array containing one match: `["GeeksforGeeks"]`.
   - The output will be:
     ```
     Found 1 match: GeeksforGeeks
     ```

### Example 2: Replacing the Word "Geeky"

```javascript
function geek() {
  let str1 = "Geeky@128";
  let regex4 = new RegExp("\\bGeeky", "gi");  // Regular expression to match the word 'Geeky'
  let replace = "GFG";  // Replacement string
  let match4 = str1.replace(regex4, replace);  // Using replace() to replace the match

  console.log("New string: " + match4);  // Logging the new string
}
geek();
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Regular Expression**: `new RegExp("\\bGeeky", "gi")`
   - `\\b`: This is a **word boundary** anchor. It matches the position between a word character and a non-word character.
   - `Geeky`: This is the literal word to match.
   - `g`: The **global** flag ensures the search is across the entire string.
   - `i`: The **case-insensitive** flag makes the search case-insensitive.

   *Note*: We used `new RegExp("\\bGeeky", "gi")` instead of a regular literal pattern to demonstrate how the `RegExp` constructor works. `\\b` is used instead of just `\b` because in a string, the backslash `\` needs to be escaped with another backslash.

2. **`replace()`**: The `replace()` method is used to replace all occurrences of the matched pattern with the specified replacement string. Here, `"Geeky"` is replaced with `"GFG"`.

3. **Input String**: `"Geeky@128"`
   - The regular expression `/\bGeeky/gi` matches the word `"Geeky"`, as it's the start of the string and a standalone word.
   - The match is then replaced with `"GFG"`, so the new string becomes `"GFG@128"`.

4. **Output**:
   - The string `"Geeky@128"` is modified to `"GFG@128"`, and the output will be:
     ```
     New string: GFG@128
     ```

### Summary of Key Points:

1. **Word Boundary `\b`**:
   - The `\b` anchor matches the **position** between a word character (like letters and numbers) and a non-word character (like spaces, punctuation, or the string boundaries).
   - This ensures that you match complete words and not partial ones.

2. **Regular Expressions with Flags**:
   - The `g` flag ensures the regular expression is applied globally across the string.
   - The `i` flag makes the regular expression case-insensitive, so it matches both `"Geeky"` and `"geeky"`, for example.

3. **`match()`**: 
   - Used to find all matches in the string that fit the regular expression.

4. **`replace()`**:
   - Replaces all occurrences of the matched pattern with the specified replacement string.

### Outputs:

1. For the first example with `"GeeksforGeeks@_123_$"`:
   ```
   Found 1 match: GeeksforGeeks
   ```

2. For the second example with `"Geeky@128"`:
   ```
   New string: GFG@128
   ```

These examples demonstrate how regular expressions can be used with word boundaries to detect and modify specific words in strings efficiently.
