### Explanation of the Code:

The goal of this code is to remove consecutive duplicate characters from a given string.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

### Regular Expression: `/(\.)\1+/g`
- **`(.)`**: 
  - This is a capturing group that matches any character. The parentheses around the period `.` define a capturing group, meaning whatever character matches here will be captured for use in the replacement. 
- **`\1`**: 
  - This is a backreference to the first capturing group `(.)`. It matches the same character that was captured in the first group.
- **`+`**: 
  - This quantifier matches one or more occurrences of the previous character (the character matched by `\1`).
- **`g`**: 
  - This flag stands for "global" and ensures that all matches in the string are replaced, not just the first one.

### The Replace Method:
- The `.replace()` method takes two arguments:
  - **Search Pattern**: A regular expression (in this case, `/(\.)\1+/g`).
  - **Replacement**: A string or function that replaces the matched characters. Here, `$1` refers to the first capturing group `(.)`, which means we are replacing the entire sequence of repeated characters with only the first character in that sequence.

### Steps of Execution:
1. The function `eleminateSameConsecutiveCharacters` is called with the string `"Geeks For Geeks"`.
2. The regular expression `/(\.)\1+/g` matches any consecutive duplicate characters (i.e., it finds sequences where one character repeats multiple times in a row).
3. The `.replace()` method replaces the sequence of repeated characters with only the first character of that sequence (thanks to `$1` in the replacement part).
4. The modified string is returned.

### Example:

```javascript
const testString = "Geeks For Geeks";
console.log(eleminateSameConsecutiveCharacters(testString));
```

#### Execution Details:
- **Input**: `"Geeks For Geeks"`
- The regex matches the following sequences:
  - `"Geeks"` → The consecutive "e"s are removed.
  - `" For"` → The consecutive space is retained.
  - `"Geeks"` → The consecutive "e"s are removed again.

#### Output:
```javascript
"Geks For Geks"
```

So, the consecutive duplicate characters have been removed, and the result is `"Geks For Geks"`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty String**:
   - If you pass an empty string, the result will be an empty string.
   ```javascript
   console.log(eleminateSameConsecutiveCharacters('')); // ""
   ```

2. **No Consecutive Duplicates**:
   - If the input string has no consecutive duplicates, the string will remain unchanged.
   ```javascript
   console.log(eleminateSameConsecutiveCharacters('abcd')); // "abcd"
   ```

3. **All Same Characters**:
   - If the entire string consists of the same character, only one character will be retained.
   ```javascript
   console.log(eleminateSameConsecutiveCharacters('aaaaa')); // "a"
   ```

4. **Multiple Spaces**:
   - If there are multiple consecutive spaces, they will be reduced to a single space.
   ```javascript
   console.log(eleminateSameConsecutiveCharacters('Geeks    For   Geeks')); // "Geks For Geks"
   ```

### Conclusion:
The function `eleminateSameConsecutiveCharacters` efficiently removes consecutive duplicate characters from a string using regular expressions. It's an elegant and concise way to handle this problem, leveraging the power of regex for pattern matching and replacement.
