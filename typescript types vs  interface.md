In TypeScript, both `types` and `interfaces` are used to define shapes of objects, and they serve a similar purpose but have some key differences in how they can be used and extended. Here's a comparison between the two:

### 1. **Basic Syntax:**
   - **Type Aliases:**
     ```typescript
     type Person = {
       name: string;
       age: number;
     };
     ```
   - **Interfaces:**
     ```typescript
     interface Person {
       name: string;
       age: number;
     }
     ```

### 2. **Extension/Inheritance:**
   - **Interfaces:**
     Interfaces can be extended using the `extends` keyword.
     ```typescript
     interface Employee extends Person {
       employeeId: number;
     }
     ```
   - **Types:**
     Types can extend other types using intersection (`&`).
     ```typescript
     type Employee = Person & {
       employeeId: number;
     };
     ```

### 3. **Declaration Merging (Only for Interfaces):**
   - **Interfaces:**
     Interfaces support declaration merging, meaning you can declare an interface multiple times, and TypeScript will merge them together.
     ```typescript
     interface Person {
       name: string;
     }

     interface Person {
       age: number;
     }

     const person: Person = { name: 'John', age: 30 }; // No error
     ```
   - **Types:**
     Types do not support declaration merging. If you declare a type with the same name twice, you will get a duplicate identifier error.
     ```typescript
     type Person = {
       name: string;
     };

     type Person = { // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Person'.
       age: number;
     };
     ```

### 4. **Use in Advanced Types:**
   - **Types:**
     Types are more flexible and can be used for more complex type compositions, such as union types, intersection types, and mapped types.
     ```typescript
     type Animal = { name: string };
     type Dog = Animal & { breed: string }; // Intersection type
     type Cat = Animal | { breed: string }; // Union type
     ```
   - **Interfaces:**
     Interfaces are generally used for object shapes but can’t be used for unions or intersections. They are more restrictive in this regard.
     ```typescript
     interface Animal { name: string; }
     interface Dog extends Animal { breed: string; }
     // But can't do union like: Animal | Dog
     ```

### 5. **Instantiating Objects:**
   - **Interfaces:**
     You can use interfaces to type objects directly and create object structures that can be implemented in classes.
     ```typescript
     interface Animal {
       name: string;
     }
     class Dog implements Animal {
       name: string;
       constructor(name: string) {
         this.name = name;
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Types:**
     Types can be used similarly, but they are not intended to be used for class implementation. They can be used for object shapes as well.
     ```typescript
     type Animal = { name: string };
     const dog: Animal = { name: 'Rex' };
     ```

### 6. **When to Use Types vs. Interfaces:**
   - **Use `interface` when:**
     - You want to define an object shape and ensure it's extendable.
     - You want to take advantage of declaration merging.
     - You are working with class-based structures.
   - **Use `type` when:**
     - You need more complex type compositions (like unions, intersections, mapped types, etc.).
     - You need to define primitive types, tuple types, or function signatures.
     - You want more flexibility in expressing types.

### 7. **Summary of Key Differences:**

| Feature                        | `Interface`                             | `Type Alias`                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Extends other types            | Uses `extends`                         | Uses intersection (`&`)                 |
| Declaration merging            | Supports declaration merging            | Does not support declaration merging     |
| Usage flexibility              | More specialized for object shapes      | More flexible for advanced types (union, intersection, etc.) |
| Compatibility with classes     | Can be implemented by classes           | Cannot be implemented by classes         |
| Can be used for                | Object types, method signatures, classes | Object types, primitive types, unions, intersections, tuples, etc. |

### Conclusion:
- Use `interface` for defining object shapes and when you want to take advantage of its ability to be merged and extended.
- Use `type` when you need more advanced and flexible type definitions, especially for unions, intersections, and more complex type operations.
