// You should use Async operation over Sync operation in JavaScript to better utilize JavaScript's event-driven nature⚡ 

// 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝘆𝗻𝗰 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀? 

// Well, in simple words, they're just different ways of handling tasks in JavaScript. Sync operations, or synchronous operations, are like doing one thing at a time. You have to wait for one task to finish before moving on to the next one. On the other hand, Async operations, or asynchronous operations, allow you to do multiple things at once without waiting.

// The answer lies in JavaScript's event-driven nature. JavaScript is really good at handling tasks in the background while still being able to respond to user actions or events. Async operations take advantage of this by allowing your code to keep running smoothly even while waiting for other tasks to finish. 

// This can make your programs more efficient and responsive, especially when dealing with tasks like fetching data from a server or processing large amounts of information.

// For instance, if you need to ensure that a task is completed before moving on to the next one, Sync operations can be helpful. But in general, Async operations are preferred for most tasks because they make your code faster and more efficient, taking full advantage of JavaScript's strengths as a language.

// So, next time you're writing JavaScript code and you have tasks that could take some time to complete, consider using Async operations. It's a simple way to make your code faster and more efficient, and it takes advantage of JavaScript's event-driven nature. 



// What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?

// Synchronous code runs in sequence. This means that each operation must wait for the previous one to complete before executing.

// console.log('One');
// console.log('Two');
// console.log('Three');
// // LOGS: 'One', 'Two', 'Three'
// Asynchronous code runs in parallel. This means that an operation can occur while another one is still being processed.

// console.log('One');
// setTimeout(() => console.log('Two'), 100);
// console.log('Three');
// // LOGS: 'One', 'Three', 'Two'
// Asynchronous code execution is often preferable in situations where execution can be blocked indefinitely. Some examples of this are network requests, long-running calculations, file system operations etc. Using asynchronous code in the browser ensures the page remains responsive and the user experience is mostly unaffected.
