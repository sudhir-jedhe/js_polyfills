The problem you're trying to solve involves creating a function `mapLimit` that processes an array with an asynchronous iteratee function while respecting a concurrency limit. This function should process multiple items in parallel, but with a constraint on how many can be processed at once. If any task fails, the entire operation should fail.

To solve this, we break the task into several steps:
1. **Chunk the Input Array**: Split the array into chunks where each chunk's size corresponds to the concurrency limit.
2. **Process Each Chunk Sequentially**: We use `reduce` to process each chunk in series, ensuring that one chunk is fully processed before the next starts.
3. **Process Each Item in Parallel**: Inside each chunk, we process the items in parallel using `Promise.all`.
4. **Handle Errors**: If any task fails, reject the entire promise.

The solution you're aiming for is closely related to `async.parallel` (for parallel processing within a chunk) and `async.series` (to process chunks sequentially).

### Here's how to implement the `mapLimit` function:

```javascript
// Helper function to chop array into chunks of a given size
Array.prototype.chop = function (size) {
  const temp = [...this];
  const output = [];
  let i = 0;
  while (i < temp.length) {
    output.push(temp.slice(i, i + size));
    i += size;
  }
  return output;
};

// mapLimit function implementation
const mapLimit = (arr, limit, fn) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Chop the input array into chunks of size 'limit'
    let chunks = arr.chop(limit);
    
    // Use reduce to process each chunk in series
    const final = chunks.reduce((promiseChain, chunk) => {
      return promiseChain.then((result) => {
        // Process the chunk in parallel using Promise.all
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          const results = [];
          let tasksCompleted = 0;

          // Process each item in the current chunk
          chunk.forEach((item, index) => {
            fn(item, (err, value) => {
              if (err) {
                reject("Error in processing item"); // Reject on any error
              } else {
                results[index] = value;
                tasksCompleted++;
                // Once all tasks in the chunk are processed, resolve this chunk's promise
                if (tasksCompleted === chunk.length) {
                  resolve([...result, ...results]); // Combine the results with the previous ones
                }
              }
            });
          });
        });
      });
    }, Promise.resolve([]));

    // After processing all chunks, return the final result
    final.then(resolve).catch(reject);
  });
};

// Test Case 1: All inputs resolve
let numPromise = mapLimit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, function (num, callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    num = num * 2;
    console.log(num);
    callback(null, num);
  }, 2000);
});

numPromise
  .then((result) => console.log("success:", result))
  .catch(() => console.log("no success"));

// Test Case 2: One of the tasks rejects
let numPromise2 = mapLimit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, function (num, callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    num = num * 2;
    console.log(num);

    // Reject if num equals 6
    if (num === 6) {
      callback(true); // Simulate an error
    } else {
      callback(null, num);
    }
  }, 2000);
});

numPromise2
  .then((result) => console.log("success:", result))
  .catch(() => console.log("no success"));
```

### **Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Chopping the Array:**
   - We use the `chop` method to break the input array (`arr`) into chunks of size `limit`. This ensures that we don't exceed the maximum concurrency at any given time.

2. **Processing Chunks Sequentially (`reduce`):**
   - The `reduce` function is used to ensure that chunks are processed in series. We use `Promise.resolve([])` as the initial value, which will accumulate results from each chunk as it's processed.

3. **Parallel Processing of Items in a Chunk (`Promise.all`):**
   - For each chunk, we process the items in parallel using the `fn` function (the async iteratee). Each item in the chunk is processed using the provided callback. If any item fails (i.e., if `err` is truthy), we immediately reject the promise.

4. **Combining Results:**
   - After each chunk is processed in parallel, we combine its results with the previous chunk's results (using `resolve([...result, ...results])`).

5. **Handling Errors:**
   - If any error occurs, the entire process is rejected, and the promise will catch it in the `.catch()` block.

### **Test Case 1 (All inputs resolve):**

**Expected Output:**

```
2
4
6
8
10
success: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

- The numbers are doubled, and the process occurs in batches of 3, as specified by the limit.
- The first three items (`1, 2, 3`) are processed in parallel, then the next two items (`4, 5`) are processed after the first batch finishes.

---

### **Test Case 2 (One of the tasks rejects):**

**Expected Output:**

```
2
4
6
no success
```

- The first two items (`1` and `2`) are processed successfully, but when the number `3` is doubled to `6`, the callback is called with an error (`callback(true)`), which causes the entire operation to reject.
  
---

### **Edge Cases to Consider:**
1. **Empty Input Array**: If the input array is empty, the function should resolve immediately with an empty array.
2. **All Items Fail**: If all items fail (e.g., if every number is `6`), the function should reject after the first failure.
3. **Limit Larger than Array Length**: If the limit is greater than the array length, the entire array should be processed in parallel.

---

### **Conclusion:**
This implementation ensures that:
- The tasks are processed with the specified concurrency limit.
- The overall operation is rejected if any task fails.
- The tasks are processed in series for each chunk, but each chunk's items are processed in parallel.
