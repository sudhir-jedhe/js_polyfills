Based on the content of the attachment, I'll create a Node.js Executable block to demonstrate the functionality of both the `AsyncRequestQueue` and `requestQueue` implementations. This will allow users to see how these asynchronous request handlers work in practice.

```javascript project="Async Request Handlers" file="asyncRequestHandlers.js"
...
```

This Node.js Executable block demonstrates both the `AsyncRequestQueue` and `requestQueue` implementations. It uses the `node-fetch` library to make actual API calls to a mock API (JSONPlaceholder) and includes error handling to show how errors are managed in both implementations.

The example includes:

1. Creating and using an `AsyncRequestQueue` instance to process multiple requests.
2. Using the `requestQueue` function to process an array of request functions.
3. Simulating successful API calls and errors to demonstrate error handling in both implementations.


Users can run this code to see how these asynchronous request handlers work in practice, including how they handle both successful requests and errors.
