The function `isBoomerang` you're implementing checks whether three given points form a boomerang or not. A boomerang is formed when the three points are not collinear (i.e., they don't lie on the same straight line). To check if three points are collinear, you can compute the slopes between each pair of points. If the slopes are different, then the points are not collinear, and the shape formed is a boomerang.

### Issue in Your Current Implementation:
Your approach using slopes (`slope1` and `slope2`) is almost correct, but it has a potential bug. The formula you are using to check for collinearity involves multiplying differences in coordinates (`(y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2)`) and `(y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)`. While this is correct in concept, it could lead to division by zero or precision errors when calculating slopes as floating-point numbers, especially if the points are vertical (same x-values) or horizontal (same y-values).

### Fixing the Calculation:
Instead of directly calculating slopes, you can use the **cross-product** approach to avoid division and check for collinearity more reliably. The formula for determining if three points \((x1, y1)\), \((x2, y2)\), and \((x3, y3)\) are collinear is:

\[
(x2 - x1) \times (y3 - y1) = (x3 - x1) \times (y2 - y1)
\]

If the above equation holds true, the points are collinear, meaning they lie on the same line. If it does not hold true, the points form a boomerang (they are non-collinear).

### Updated Code:

```javascript
export function isBoomerang(points) {
  const [x1, y1] = points[0];
  const [x2, y2] = points[1];
  const [x3, y3] = points[2];

  // Calculate cross product to check for collinearity
  const crossProduct = (x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) !== (x3 - x1) * (y2 - y1);

  // Return true if points are not collinear (boomerang)
  return crossProduct;
}

const points1 = [
  [1, 1],
  [2, 3],
  [3, 2],
];
console.log(isBoomerang(points1)); // Output: true

const points2 = [
  [1, 1],
  [2, 2],
  [3, 3],
];
console.log(isBoomerang(points2)); // Output: false
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The condition `(x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) !== (x3 - x1) * (y2 - y1)` checks if the points are not collinear.
- If this condition is `true`, then the points form a **boomerang** (non-collinear).
- If the condition is `false`, then the points are collinear, and thus **not a boomerang**.

### Test Cases:

1. **Points that form a boomerang**:
   ```javascript
   const points1 = [
     [1, 1],
     [2, 3],
     [3, 2],
   ];
   console.log(isBoomerang(points1)); // Output: true
   ```
   - The points `(1,1)`, `(2,3)`, and `(3,2)` are non-collinear, so they form a boomerang.

2. **Points that are collinear (do not form a boomerang)**:
   ```javascript
   const points2 = [
     [1, 1],
     [2, 2],
     [3, 3],
   ];
   console.log(isBoomerang(points2)); // Output: false
   ```
   - The points `(1,1)`, `(2,2)`, and `(3,3)` are collinear (they lie on the line `y = x`), so they do not form a boomerang.

This updated code should work correctly for all cases, avoiding potential pitfalls with slope calculation and precision.
