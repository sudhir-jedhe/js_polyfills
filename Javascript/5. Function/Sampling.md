*** copy Sampling.md ***

The code you provided defines a **sampler function** that executes a given function (`fn`) once after a specified number of calls (`count`). Here's a breakdown of the code and how it works:

### Function Breakdown:

1. **sampler(fn, count, context)**:
   - **fn**: The function that will be executed after the specified number of calls.
   - **count**: The number of calls before `fn` is executed.
   - **context**: The context (`this` value) in which the function should be executed. If no context is provided, the default `this` value will be used (i.e., the context of the caller).

2. **counter**: A counter to track how many times the returned function has been invoked.

3. **returned function**: This function, when called, increments the `counter`. If the `counter` reaches the specified `count`, it invokes `fn` with the provided arguments and resets the `counter`. Otherwise, it does nothing.

### Code Explanation:

```javascript
function sampler(fn, count, context) {
  let counter = 0;

  return function (...args) {
    // Store the last arguments passed to the sampler function
    let lastArgs = args;

    // If no context is provided, use the calling context (this)
    context = this ?? context;

    // Execute the function only when the counter reaches the target count
    if (++counter !== count) return;

    // Call the function with the provided context and arguments
    fn.apply(context, lastArgs);

    // Reset the counter to 0 for subsequent calls
    counter = 0;
  };
}

function message() {
  console.log("hello");
}

const sample = sampler(message, 4);

// Calling the function multiple times to demonstrate the behavior
sample(); // No output
sample(); // No output
sample(); // No output
sample(); // Output: "hello"
sample(); // No output
sample(); // No output
sample(); // No output
sample(); // Output: "hello"
```

### How It Works:

1. When you call the `sample()` function, it increments the counter each time.
2. Once the counter reaches the specified `count` (in this case, `4`), it executes the provided `fn` (`message()`) and prints `"hello"`.
3. After the function is executed, the counter is reset to `0`, and it starts counting again from the next call.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **First round of calls**:
  - Call 1: Counter is `1`, function doesn't run.
  - Call 2: Counter is `2`, function doesn't run.
  - Call 3: Counter is `3`, function doesn't run.
  - Call 4: Counter is `4`, function runs and outputs `"hello"`.
- **Second round of calls**:
  - Call 1: Counter is `1`, function doesn't run.
  - Call 2: Counter is `2`, function doesn't run.
  - Call 3: Counter is `3`, function doesn't run.
  - Call 4: Counter is `4`, function runs again and outputs `"hello"`.

### Notes:

1. **Context**: The `context` parameter allows you to specify what `this` should refer to inside the function when it is called. If not explicitly provided, the default `this` value will be used. This is especially important if you're working with methods within an object.
2. **`args`**: The function arguments are captured using the rest parameter (`...args`), so that the sampler function works with any number of arguments passed to the function it is wrapping.

### Improvements and Considerations:

- **Resetting `counter` after execution**: The counter is reset after `fn` is called, which means that subsequent calls will again count towards the next `count` value.
- **Multiple `sampler` instances**: Each call to `sampler()` creates a new function with its own counter, meaning that multiple `sampler` instances can exist independently.

This is a useful technique when you want to limit how many times a function can be executed, such as delaying an action until after a certain number of invocations or for rate-limiting scenarios.

Let me know if you'd like further explanation or if there are any other details you're curious about!

The `sampler` function (often called `throttle` or `sample`) wraps a target function (`fn`) and ensures it is executed **at most once every $N$ calls** (or time intervals), using the provided `count` threshold and optional `context` (`this` binding).

Here is the implementation of `sampler` based on call count execution:

---

### Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a sampled version of `fn` that executes only on every `count`-th call.
 *
 * @param {Function} fn - The target function to execute.
 * @param {number} count - The invocation threshold (e.g., 3 = run on 3rd, 6th, 9th call).
 * @param {Object} [context] - Optional 'this' binding context for `fn`.
 * @returns {Function} The wrapped sampler function.
 */
function sampler(fn, count, context) {
  let callCount = 0;

  if (typeof fn !== "function") {
    throw new TypeError("Expected a function");
  }

  if (count <= 0) {
    throw new RangeError("Count must be a positive integer greater than 0");
  }

  return function (...args) {
    callCount++;

    // Execute only when the call count reaches a multiple of `count`
    if (callCount % count === 0) {
      // Use explicit context if provided, otherwise default to current execution context
      return fn.apply(context || this, args);
    }
  };
}
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Sample Function
function logMessage(msg) {
  console.log(`[${this.user || "Guest"}] Message: ${msg}`);
}

const userContext = { user: "Alex" };

// Execute logMessage only on every 3rd call, bound to userContext
const sampledLog = sampler(logMessage, 3, userContext);

sampledLog("Call 1"); // (Ignored)
sampledLog("Call 2"); // (Ignored)
sampledLog("Call 3"); // ➔ Prints: "[Alex] Message: Call 3"

sampledLog("Call 4"); // (Ignored)
sampledLog("Call 5"); // (Ignored)
sampledLog("Call 6"); // ➔ Prints: "[Alex] Message: Call 6"
```

### Time-Based Variation (`samplerTime`)

If your requirement for `sampler` means sampling a function at fixed **time intervals** (e.g., run `fn` at most once every `ms` milliseconds) rather than call counts:

```javascript
function samplerTime(fn, delayMs, context) {
  let lastRan = 0;

  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();

    if (now - lastRan >= delayMs) {
      lastRan = now;
      return fn.apply(context || this, args);
    }
  };
}
```
