***  What is the difference between `slice()` and `splice()` in JavaScript.md ***

Here are answers to your questions:

### 1. What is the difference between `slice()` and `splice()` in JavaScript?

- **`slice()`**:
  - Does not modify the original array.
  - Creates a shallow copy of a portion of an array, selected from a start index to an end index.
  - Syntax: `array.slice(startIndex, endIndex)`
  - Returns a new array with the extracted portion.

- **`splice()`**:
  - Modifies the original array.
  - Used to add, remove, or replace elements from an array.
  - Syntax: `array.splice(startIndex, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)`
  - Returns an array of removed elements (if any).

 What is the difference between `find()` and `findIndex()`?

- **`find()`**: Returns the first element that satisfies the condition.

  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const found = arr.find((element) => element > 2); // 3
  ```

- **`findIndex()`**: Returns the index of the first element that satisfies the condition.

  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const index = arr.findIndex((element) => element > 2); // 2
  ```
