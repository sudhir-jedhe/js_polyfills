*** copy Refference Error.md ***

A **`ReferenceError`** in JavaScript is thrown when your code attempts to access a variable that has not been declared or is not currently accessible in the current scope. It is the JavaScript engine's way of saying, "I don't know what this identifier refers to."

Here are the most common causes of a `ReferenceError` and how to resolve them.

## 1. Misspelled Variable Names (Typos)

The most frequent cause is simply typing a variable name incorrectly. JavaScript is case-sensitive, so `myVariable` and `myvariable` are treated as entirely different entities.

```javascript
let currentScore = 100;

// Throws ReferenceError: currentscore is not defined
console.log(currentscore); 

```

**Fix:** Double-check your spelling and casing.

## 2. Accessing Out-of-Scope Variables

If you declare a variable inside a function or a block, it is "trapped" there. Trying to use it outside of that boundary will result in a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
function calculateDiscount() {
  let discount = 20; // This variable is function-scoped
}

// Throws ReferenceError: discount is not defined
console.log(discount); 

if (true) {
  const message = "Hello"; // This is block-scoped
}

// Throws ReferenceError: message is not defined
console.log(message);

```

**Fix:** Ensure you are only trying to access variables within the blocks or functions where they were originally declared, or move the declaration to an outer scope if multiple functions need access to it.

## 3. The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

When you use `let` or `const`, JavaScript hoists the variable declarations to the top of their scope, but it does not initialize them. The space between the start of the block and the exact line where the variable is defined is called the **Temporal Dead Zone**. Accessing the variable in this zone throws an error.

```javascript
// Throws ReferenceError: Cannot access 'greeting' before initialization
console.log(greeting); 

let greeting = "Welcome!";

```

**Fix:** Always declare your `let` and `const` variables before you try to read or manipulate them. (Note: `var` behaves differently and would output `undefined` instead of throwing an error).

## 4. Strict Mode Assigments

In standard JavaScript (non-strict mode), assigning a value to a variable you never declared accidentally creates a global variable. However, if you are using Strict Mode (`"use strict";` or working within a JavaScript Module), this behavior is blocked to prevent bugs.

```javascript
"use strict";

// Throws ReferenceError: userAge is not defined
userAge = 25; 

```

**Fix:** Always declare your variables with `const`, `let`, or `var` before assigning values to them.

Occur at runtime when trying to access a variable or function that does not exist or has not been initialized yet.

```javascript
// Example 1: Accessing an undeclared variable
console.log(nonExistentVar);

// Example 2: Accessing let/const variable before initialization (Temporal Dead Zone)
console.log(myVar);
let myVar = 10;

// Example 3: Variable accessed outside its function scope
function setScore() {
  let score = 100;
}
console.log(score);

// Example 4: Typo in variable name
const userAge = 25;
console.log(userAges);

// Example 5: Calling a function that hasn't been defined
renderPage();

```
