*** copy constructor.md ***

Let's break down what happens when you run this code.

### Code Explanation

```javascript
function A() {
  this.dev1 = "BFE"; // this sets the dev1 property on the instance of A
  this.dev2 = "dev"; // this sets the dev2 property on the instance of A
  return {
    dev1: "bigfrontend", // this is the returned object that overrides dev1
  };
}

const a = new A(); // we are creating an instance of A
console.log(a.dev1); // this logs dev1 from the returned object
console.log(a.dev2); // this logs dev2 from the instance of A
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Inside the constructor `A()`:**
   - You have two properties: `dev1` and `dev2`, which are set to `"BFE"` and `"dev"`, respectively, on `this` (the instance of `A`).
   - However, at the end of the constructor, you're **explicitly returning an object**: `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }`.

2. **`new A()` invocation:**
   - When `new A()` is called, the constructor function is executed. Normally, the `new` operator creates a new empty object, and within the constructor, `this` refers to that new object.
   - The return value of a constructor function is typically the new object (`this`). However, **if a constructor explicitly returns an object**, that object is used instead of the newly created object. In your case, you are returning an object: `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }`.

3. **What happens when `return { dev1: "bigfrontend" }` is executed?**
   - This effectively **overrides** the `this` object and returns `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }` instead of the default object that was being created with `dev1` and `dev2` properties set to `"BFE"` and `"dev"`.
4. **Properties of the returned object:**
   - The returned object has only one property: `dev1` set to `"bigfrontend"`.
   - The property `dev2` (which was initially set to `"dev"`) is not returned because the constructor returned a new object, which doesn't have `dev2`.

### Output

- `console.log(a.dev1);`: The value of `dev1` in the returned object is `"bigfrontend"`, so this logs `"bigfrontend"`.
- `console.log(a.dev2);`: Since `dev2` is not part of the returned object and wasn't overridden in the constructor's return object, it logs `undefined`, because the returned object doesn't have `dev2`.

### Final Output

```javascript
bigfrontend;
undefined;
```

### Key Points

- When you return an object from a constructor, it **replaces** the instance (`this`) object created by `new`.
- Properties that are set on `this` inside the constructor will still be available unless they are overwritten by the returned object.

Here's my take: There is a **critical mistake in the explanation for `console.log(a.dev2)**`, even though the first part about `a.dev1` is accurate.

### What Actually Happens

When a constructor function called with `new` returns an **object**, JavaScript **completely replaces and discards** the newly created instance.

Here is what actually logs when you run this code:

```javascript
console.log(a.dev1); // Outputs: "bigfrontend"
console.log(a.dev2); // Outputs: undefined  (NOT "dev")
```

### Why `a.dev2` is `undefined`

In JavaScript, constructor functions behave according to these rules when invoked with the `new` keyword:

1. **Rule 1 (Primitives):** If the constructor returns a primitive value (like a `string`, `number`, `boolean`, or `null`), JavaScript **ignores** the return statement and returns the newly constructed `this` instance.
2. **Rule 2 (Objects):** If the constructor explicitly returns an **Object** (like `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }`, an array, or a function), JavaScript **overrides and discards the entire `this` instance** and returns that returned object instead.

---

### Step-by-Step Code Execution

```javascript
function A() {
  this.dev1 = "BFE";
  this.dev2 = "dev";

  // Returning an object literal!
  return {
    dev1: "bigfrontend",
  };
}

const a = new A();
```

1. `new A()` creates a hidden internal instance `{ dev1: "BFE", dev2: "dev" }`.
2. The function encounters `return { dev1: "bigfrontend" }`.
3. Because the returned value is an **object**, JS discards the `this` instance entirely.
4. `a` is now assigned the returned object: `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }`.
5. `a.dev1` exists on the returned object $\rightarrow$ `"bigfrontend"`.
6. `a.dev2` **does NOT exist** on `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }` $\rightarrow$ `undefined`.

### Summary Checklist

```javascript
// Example A: Returning an Object
function Foo() {
  this.x = 10;
  return { y: 20 };
}
console.log(new Foo()); // { y: 20 } (x is lost!)

// Example B: Returning a Primitive
function Bar() {
  this.x = 10;
  return "hello"; // Primitives are ignored
}
console.log(new Bar()); // Bar { x: 10 }
```
