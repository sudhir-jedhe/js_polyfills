Yes, whether these requests can run in parallel depends entirely on whether they depend on each other's data:

* **Can they run in parallel?** If **Order** requires the `userId` fetched from User Details, and **Payment History** requires an `orderId` from the Orders, **no**, they cannot run in parallel because of data dependencies. However, if they are completely independent endpoints that only require a base user token/ID, **yes**, they can run in parallel using `Promise.all()`.
* **How to execute them sequentially:** If each request depends on the response of the previous one (a cascading request chain), you must execute them **sequentially** using `async/await`.

### How to Execute Sequentially (Chained Dependencies)

When User Details yields an ID needed for Orders, and Orders yields an ID needed for Payments, use `async/await` in a straightforward sequence:

```javascript
async function fetchUserDataSequentially(userId) {
  try {
    // Step 1: Fetch User Details first
    const userResponse = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    const userData = await userResponse.json();
    
    // Step 2: Use user data (e.g., userData.id) to fetch Orders
    const ordersResponse = await fetch(`/api/orders?userId=${userData.id}`);
    const ordersData = await ordersResponse.json();
    
    // Step 3: Use order data (e.g., the first order's ID) to fetch Payment History
    const latestOrderId = ordersData[0]?.id;
    const paymentsResponse = await fetch(`/api/payments?orderId=${latestOrderId}`);
    const paymentHistory = await paymentsResponse.json();

    return { userData, ordersData, paymentHistory };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during sequential fetching:", error);
  }
}

```

### Alternative: What if they *can* run in parallel?

If you don't need the response of one to start the next (for example, if you already have the `userId` upfront), running them sequentially will unnecessarily slow down your page load. Instead, use **`Promise.all()`** to fetch them concurrently:

```javascript
async function fetchDashboardData(userId) {
  try {
    // All three requests fire at the same time, cutting load time drastically
    const [user, orders, payments] = await Promise.all([
      fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`).then(res => res.json()),
      fetch(`/api/users/${userId}/orders`).then(res => res.json()),
      fetch(`/api/users/${userId}/payments`).then(res => res.json())
    ]);

    return { user, orders, payments };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("One of the parallel requests failed:", error);
  }
}

```
