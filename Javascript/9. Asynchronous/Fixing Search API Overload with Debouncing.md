## Fixing Search API Overload with Debouncing

When a search API is triggered on every single keystroke, it creates a flood of redundant network requests, wastes server resources, and causes noticeable UI lag.

The standard industry solution to this problem is **Debouncing**.

---

### How Debouncing Works

Debouncing ensures that the API call is delayed until the user **stops typing** for a specified period (typically between **300ms to 500ms**). If the user types another character before the timer expires, the previous timer is cancelled and a new one starts.

---

### Implementation Example (JavaScript)

```javascript
let debounceTimer;

function handleSearchInput(event) {
    const query = event.target.value;
    
    // Clear the existing timer on every keystroke
    clearTimeout(debounceTimer);
    
    // Set a new timer to execute the API call after 400ms of inactivity
    debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
        fetchSearchResults(query);
    }, 400);
}

function fetchSearchResults(query) {
    // If the input is empty, skip the API call
    if (!query.trim()) return;
    
    console.log(`Calling Search API for: ${query}`);
    // Perform your fetch or axios request here
}

// Attach the listener to the input element
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');
searchInput.addEventListener('input', handleSearchInput);

```

### Additional Best Practices

* **Minimum Character Threshold:** Do not fire the search API until the user has typed a minimum number of characters (e.g., at least 3 characters). Searching for a single letter like "a" returns too many irrelevant results anyway.
* **Request Cancellation (AbortController):** If a user types fast enough to trigger multiple sequential requests, use JavaScript's `AbortController` to cancel any pending older requests so only the latest query matters.
