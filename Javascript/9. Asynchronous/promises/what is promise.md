# JavaScript Promises: The Complete Guide

A **Promise** is a built-in JavaScript object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It acts as a placeholder for a value that is not necessarily known when the promise is created.

## 1. What is a Promise?

A promise can produce a single resolved value or a reason for rejection (such as a network error).

### The 3 States of a Promise

At any given moment, a promise exists in one of three mutually exclusive states:

* **Pending:** Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. The operation is still in progress.
* **Fulfilled:** The asynchronous operation completed successfully, producing a result value.
* **Rejected:** The operation failed, throwing an error or reason for failure.

```text
               ┌─────────────┐
               │   Pending   │
               └──────┬──────┘
                      │
        ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
        ▼                           ▼
┌───────────────┐           ┌───────────────┐
│   Fulfilled   │           │   Rejected    │
│  (Resolved)   │           │  (Failed/Err) │
└───────────────┘           └───────────────┘

```

### Guarantees & Rules

* A pending promise can transition **only** to `Fulfilled` or `Rejected`.
* Once a promise is **settled** (either fulfilled or rejected), its state and value become immutable and cannot change.
* Promises supply a standardized `.then()` method to register callbacks.

## 2. Syntax & Basic Usage

### Creating a Promise

Pass a single executor function with `resolve` and `reject` parameters to the `Promise` constructor:

```javascript
// Definition
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const success = true;

  setTimeout(() => {
    if (success) {
      resolve("Operation completed successfully!");
    } else {
      reject(new Error("Operation failed."));
    }
  }, 1000);
});

// Consuming the Promise
myPromise
  .then((value) => console.log(value))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));

```

### Fetch API Example

Fetching remote data is a classic real-world use case for promises:

```javascript
fetch('https://my.api.com/items/1')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => console.log(json))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Failed with error: ${err}`));

```

---

## 3. Promise Chaining

Executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another is known as **Promise Chaining**. Each `.then()` handler receives the return value of the previous handler and wraps it in a new promise.

```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
})
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Logs: 1
    return result * 2;   // Returns 2
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Logs: 2
    return result * 3;   // Returns 6
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Logs: 6
    return result * 4;   // Returns 24
  });

```

---

## 4. Key Promise Combinators

### `Promise.all()`

Takes an iterable (array) of promises and resolves when **all** promises resolve, returning an array of their results in the exact same input order. If **any single promise rejects**, the entire `Promise.all` immediately rejects with that error.

```javascript
const p1 = Promise.resolve("Data 1");
const p2 = Promise.resolve("Data 2");
const p3 = Promise.resolve("Data 3");

Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
  .then((results) => console.log(results)) // Output: ["Data 1", "Data 2", "Data 3"]
  .catch((error) => console.error(`Error in promises: ${error}`));

```

### `Promise.race()`

Takes an array of promises and returns a promise that fulfills or rejects **as soon as the first promise settles** (whichever is faster).

```javascript
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, "one"));
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "two"));

Promise.race([promise1, promise2])
  .then((value) => console.log(value)); // Output: "two" (because promise2 resolved faster)

```

## 5. Pros & Cons: Promises vs. Callbacks

| Feature / Aspect      | Callbacks                                                       | Promises                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Readability**       | ❌ Prone to "Callback Hell" (Pyramid of Doom)                    | ✅ Clean linear syntax using `.then()` or `async/await`       |
| **Error Handling**    | ❌ Must handle errors inside every nested function               | ✅ Centralized error handling using `.catch()`                |
| **Parallel Logic**    | ❌ Difficult to track when multiple tasks finish                 | ✅ Built-in helpers like `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()` |
| **Execution Control** | ❌ Callback can be called too late, too early, or multiple times | ✅ Promises settle exactly once with immutable results        |
| **Complexity**        | 🟢 Simple for single one-off actions                             | 🟡 Mild conceptual overhead and setup                         |
