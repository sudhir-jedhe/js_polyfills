### Client-Server Real-Time Communication Protocols

This visual illustrates the four primary patterns used by web clients (browsers) to receive updates from a server.

---

### 1. Short Polling

> **Analogy:** *"Are we there yet?"*

* **How it works:** The browser repeatedly sends standard HTTP requests to the server at fixed intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds). The server responds immediately, whether new data is available or not.
* **Connection Lifecycle:** A new TCP/HTTP connection is established and closed for every single check.
* **Directionality:** Half-duplex (Request $\rightarrow$ Response).
* **Trade-offs:**
* **Pros:** Simple to implement; works with standard HTTP caching and infrastructure.
* **Cons:** High network overhead, wasted bandwidth with empty responses ("No"), and built-in latency (updates are delayed up to the polling interval).

* **Best For:**
* Simple, low-traffic applications
* Infrequent updates where a several-second latency is acceptable (e.g., background status checks).

### 2. Long Polling

> **Analogy:** *"Tell me when something happens."*

* **How it works:** The browser sends an HTTP request, and the server **holds the request open** (hangs) until new data becomes available or a timeout occurs. Once the server responds with data, the client immediately sends a new request to wait for the next update.
* **Connection Lifecycle:** Sequential, long-lived HTTP connections that terminate upon data delivery and re-open immediately.
* **Directionality:** Half-duplex (Request $\rightarrow$ Deferred Response).
* **Trade-offs:**
* **Pros:** Lower latency than short polling; eliminates empty "No" responses.
* **Cons:** Overhead of reconnecting after every event; server must manage many pending connections.

* **Best For:**
* Infrequent, unpredictable events
* Environments where WebSocket/SSE are blocked by corporate proxies or unsupported by clients.

### 3. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

> **Analogy:** *"I'll keep you updated."*

* **How it works:** The browser opens a single HTTP connection using the standard `EventSource` API. The connection remains open indefinitely, allowing the server to push text data/events downstream as they occur.
* **Connection Lifecycle:** A single, persistent HTTP connection.
* **Directionality:** **Unidirectional (Server $\rightarrow$ Client)**.
* **Trade-offs:**
* **Pros:** Built on standard HTTP (works over HTTP/2, traverses firewalls easily); native auto-reconnection and event IDs; very low overhead for server pushes.
* **Cons:** Client cannot send messages back over the same stream (must make separate HTTP POST requests).

* **Best For:**
* Live news feeds and social media feeds
* Real-time financial/crypto tickers
* Live scoreboards and dashboards
* LLM streaming responses (e.g., ChatGPT/Gemini token streaming)

---

### 4. WebSocket

> **Analogy:** *"Let's keep talking."*

* **How it works:** Starts with an HTTP Upgrade handshake, then establishes a persistent, bi-directional TCP socket connection (`ws://` or `wss://`). Both the client and server can send lightweight binary or text frames to each other at any time with minimal header overhead.
* **Connection Lifecycle:** Single, persistent full-duplex TCP connection.
* **Directionality:** **Bidirectional (Client $\leftrightarrow$ Server)**.
* **Trade-offs:**
* **Pros:** Lowest latency; minimal per-message overhead; true simultaneous two-way streaming.
* **Cons:** Custom protocol (not standard HTTP); does not support native HTTP caching; requires load balancer support and connection state management.

* **Best For:**
* Instant messaging and multi-user chat applications
* Real-time multiplayer gaming
* Collaborative tools (e.g., Google Docs, Figma cursor sync)
* High-frequency financial trading desks
