Frontend Interview Challenge: Can You Design an Event Emitter?

If you're preparing for Frontend interviews, don't focus only on React Hooks or JavaScript syntax.

Many product-based companies include implementation-based questions that test how you think, design APIs, and write scalable code.

One interesting question that often appears in interviews is:

💻 Design an Event Emitter

Your task is to implement an Event Emitter that supports methods like:

✅ on() → Register an event listener

✅ emit() → Trigger an event and notify all listeners

✅ off() → Remove a specific listener

✅ once() → Execute a listener only once

It sounds simple...

But it evaluates several important engineering concepts.

🧠 What Interviewers Are Actually Testing

This isn't just a coding exercise.

They're evaluating your understanding of:

✅ Data Structures

✅ Closures

✅ Object-Oriented Design

✅ State Management

✅ API Design

✅ Edge Case Handling

✅ Time & Space Complexity

💡 Common Follow-up Questions

Once you've implemented the solution, interviewers may ask:

👉 How would you prevent duplicate listeners?

👉 What happens if a listener throws an exception?

👉 How would you make it type-safe using TypeScript?

👉 Can multiple events share the same callback?

👉 How would you optimize memory usage?

👉 What's the time complexity of on(), emit(), and off()?

👉 How would you support wildcard events like user:*?

🎯 Why This Question Matters

Event Emitters are used in many real-world systems:

✔ Browser Events

✔ Node.js EventEmitter

✔ WebSocket Applications

✔ Pub/Sub Architecture

✔ Notification Systems

✔ Analytics Events

✔ Custom JavaScript Libraries

Understanding this pattern helps you beyond interviews—it improves how you design decoupled and maintainable applications.

🚀 Interview Tip

Don't jump into coding immediately.

Start by asking clarifying questions:

✔ Can multiple listeners be registered for the same event?

✔ Should listeners execute in registration order?

✔ What should happen if one listener fails?

✔ Do we need support for asynchronous listeners?

✔ Is thread safety or concurrency a concern?
