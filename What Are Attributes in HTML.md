In HTML, attributes provide additional information about an element. They are used to define properties or behaviors of HTML elements, and they are always written inside the opening tag of an element. Attributes modify or configure the behavior, appearance, or functionality of an HTML element.

An attribute consists of a name and a value. The name specifies the type of attribute, and the value specifies the setting for that attribute.

**Basic Syntax of Attributes**
```js
<element attribute="value">
```
The attribute name comes first.
The value is enclosed in quotes (either single or double quotes are acceptable, but double quotes are most common).
For example:

```js
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful image">
```
In this example:

src is an attribute of the `<img>` tag, and its value is "image.jpg".
alt is another attribute, and its value is "A beautiful image".
**Common HTML Attributes**
Below are some of the most commonly used HTML attributes:

```

**2. class**
**Purpose** The class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. It allows you to style multiple elements with the same class in CSS or target them in JavaScript.
