// How do you implement static code analysis in your project?
// IDE: First line of defense

// Almost all linting tools can be installed in the IDE, ensuring that all standards are followed while you code.

// Git Pre-hooks

// Run all lint tools before pushing the code to the remote repo by integrating with pre-hooks tools such as Husky to ensure that all standards are being followed.

// Tools such as ESLint also provide methods such as â€”fix to fix most of the issues found by ESLint.

// CI Pipelines

// The static analysis tools can be run just after a PR is raised or before pushing the code to production. It should fail the pipeline, PR, and push to the production environment if it fails.

// Tools for static code analysis
// ESLint

// The most widely used lint tool for JavaScript maintains conventions across the codebase and captures inconsistent formatting and styling. It comes with predefined rules, which can be modified.

// Pylint

// Prettier

// Prettier is the most popular formatting and styling tool to ensure consistency and uniformity across the codebase.


// SonarLint, SonarCloud and SonarQube

// SonarCloud is a popular cloud-based code analysis tool that can be integrated with the GitHub repo. SonarQube, a self-hosted tool, can be added to your pipelines.

// Similarly, SonarLint can be added to the IDE and provide the same configuration and enforce rules directly in your IDE.

// LGTM

// GitHub provides a tool called LGTM to directly inspect the codebase via GitHub Actions. Further details can be found on the Github LGTM

// Some other best and most popular tools are:

// DeepSource

// DeepScan

// Codacy

// JSHint

// JSLint

// Dependabot

// npm-audit

// pytype

// pylint
