function delayAll(functions: Function[], ms: number): Function[] {
    return functions.map(fn => {
        return async function () {

// Given an array functions and a number ms, return a new array of functions.

// functions is an array of functions that return promises.
// ms represents the delay duration in milliseconds. It determines the amount of time to wait before resolving each promise in the new array.
// Each function in the new array should return a promise that resolves after a delay of ms milliseconds, preserving the order of the original functions array. The delayAll function should ensure that each promise from functions is executed with a delay, forming the new array of functions returning delayed promises.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: 
// functions = [
//    () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 30))
// ], 
// ms = 50
// Output: [80]
// Explanation: The promise from the array would have resolved after 30 ms, but it was delayed by 50 ms, thus 30 ms + 50 ms = 80 ms.
// Example 2:

// Input: 
// functions = [
//     () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 50)),
//     () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 80))
// ], 
// ms = 70
// Output: [120,150]
// Explanation: The promises from the array would have resolved after 50 ms and 80 ms, but they were delayed by 7
