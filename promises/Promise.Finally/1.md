Promise.finally() is not natively supported in older browsers, thus we have to write a polyfill for it to make it work.

Same as the try…catch…finally block where no matter whether code runs in a try block or catch block, the finally block will always be executed at the end, which can be used for a cleanup operations.

The same way for Promises we have .then() for when promise resolves and .catch() for when promise rejects and .finally() block which will always run after any of those.

The finally() method of a Promise schedule a function, the callback function, to be called when the promise is settled. Like then() and catch(), it immediately returns an equivalent Promise object, allowing you to chain calls to another promise method, an operation called composition.

Input:
function checkMail() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
      resolve('Mail has arrived');
    } else {
      reject(new Error('Failed to arrive'));
    }
  });
}

checkMail()
  .then((mail) => {
    console.log(mail);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log('Experiment completed');
  });

Output:
Error: Failed to arrive
"Experiment completed"
