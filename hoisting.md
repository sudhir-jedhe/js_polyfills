These code snippets you provided revolve around several important concepts in JavaScript, including **hoisting**, **variable declaration**, **scoping**, and **function behavior**. Let’s break down some of the key principles demonstrated by each of these examples:

### 1. **Hoisting and Variable Declarations**
   **Hoisting** refers to the behavior in JavaScript where **variable declarations** (`var`, `let`, `const`) and **function declarations** are moved to the top of their scope during the **creation phase**.

   However, the behavior varies based on how variables or functions are declared:

   #### Example: `var` vs `let` and `const`
   ```javascript
   // Hoisted with `undefined`
   console.log(y); // undefined  creation phase
   var y = 10; // execution phase line by line
   ```

   - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined` in the creation phase.
   - `let` and `const` are **hoisted** too but **not initialized** (they remain in the "temporal dead zone").

   #### Example: `let` with Temporal Dead Zone
   ```javascript
   console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
   let x = 10;
   ```

   - Accessing variables declared with `let` or `const` before initialization will result in a **ReferenceError**.

### 2. **Function Hoisting**
   Function declarations are hoisted in their entirety, meaning both the **function name** and **body** are available at the top of the scope.

   #### Example: Function hoisting
   ```javascript
   function abc() {
     console.log("localScope", a); // 10
   }
   console.log("globalScope", a); // undefined
   var a = 10;
   abc(); // localScope: 10
   ```

   - Here, `var a = 10;` is hoisted to the top and initialized with `undefined`. When `abc()` is called, the value of `a` inside the function is `10`.

### 3. **Redeclaration and Overriding Functions**
   If functions or variables are redeclared, the latter one **overrides** the former.

   #### Example: Redeclaring Functions
   ```javascript
   function foo() {
     console.log(1);
   }
   var foo = 2;
   function foo() {
     console.log(3);
   }
   foo(); // Output: 3
   ```

   - When `foo` is redeclared, the second function declaration overrides the first one.

### 4. **Global vs Function Scope**
   A variable declared inside a function is local to that function. If a variable is assigned without `var`, `let`, or `const`, it **becomes global**.

   #### Example: Assigning without `var`, `let`, or `const`
   ```javascript
   function abc() {
     a = 10; // global variable (no declaration keyword)
   }
   abc();
   console.log(a); // 10
   ```

   - `a` becomes a global variable since it wasn’t declared with `var`, `let`, or `const`.

### 5. **Function Expressions and Function Declarations**
   Function expressions are **not hoisted** while function declarations are.

   #### Example: Function Expression vs Declaration
   ```javascript
   var foo = 1;

   function func1() {
     console.log(foo);
     var foo = 2;
   }

   func1(); // undefined
   ```

   - Since `foo` is redeclared within the function, JavaScript hoists the declaration (`var foo`) but **not the assignment**. So `foo` is `undefined` when logged.

### 6. **The `this` Keyword**
   The value of `this` depends on how a function is called, whether it’s in the global context, or inside an object or class.

   #### Example: `this` in a function
   ```javascript
   var a = "BFE"; // global object Window.a; in Node this is undefined
   let b = "bigfrontend"; // local script scope so this.b is undefined.
   console.log(this.a); // Output depends on the environment, Window.a in browser
   console.log(this.b); // undefined
   ```

   - In browsers, `this` refers to the global `Window` object, so `this.a` will output the global variable `a`.

### 7. **JavaScript Scope & Closures**
   JavaScript has **lexical scoping**, meaning inner functions can access variables from their outer (enclosing) scopes. 

   #### Example: Closures
   ```javascript
   let a = 1;
   (function () {
     let foo = () => a;  // arrow function closure
     let a = 2;
     console.log(foo()); // 2 (lexically, `a` is from the outer scope)
   })();
   ```

   - The `foo` function **closes over** the outer variable `a`, but because of JavaScript's scoping rules, it logs `2`, the value of `a` from the outer scope.

### 8. **Accessing Variables Inside Functions**
   Variables inside functions have their own scope, so they can't access variables declared outside them unless they are explicitly passed.

   #### Example: Function Scope
   ```javascript
   function func() {
     const a = 1;
     console.log(a); // 1
   }
   func();
   console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
   ```

   - `a` is accessible within the `func` function, but once the function finishes execution, the variable `a` is destroyed in its scope.

### 9. **`var` Hoisting Inside Functions**
   Variables declared with `var` inside functions are hoisted to the top of their function scope.

   #### Example: `var` Hoisting Inside a Function
   ```javascript
   function foo() {
     console.log(i);  // undefined (hoisted)
     for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
       console.log(i);  // 0, 1, 2
     }
   }

   foo();
   ```

   - The `var i` is hoisted to the top of the function, but the `console.log(i)` before the loop prints `undefined`.

### 10. **Strict Mode**
   In strict mode, JavaScript catches more common errors, such as using undeclared variables or assigning to `this`.

   #### Example: Strict Mode Error
   ```javascript
   'use strict';
   function abc() {
     a = 10; // ReferenceError: a is not defined
   }
   abc();
   ```

   - Using strict mode ensures that variables must be declared before use, which prevents accidental global variable creation.

---

### Summary:

- **Hoisting**: Variable declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`) and function declarations are hoisted to the top, but `var` is initialized with `undefined`, while `let` and `const` stay in the **temporal dead zone**.
- **Redeclaration**: You can redeclare a function declared with `var`, but the latest declaration will overwrite the previous one.
- **Scope**: Variables declared inside a function are local to that function. If you don't declare a variable with `var`, `let`, or `const`, it becomes a global variable.
- **Function Expressions**: These are **not hoisted**, unlike function declarations.
- **`this` Keyword**: The value of `this` depends on the context in which the function is invoked.
