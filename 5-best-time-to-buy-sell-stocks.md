You've provided several solutions for the **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks** problem. The problem can be approached in different ways depending on whether you allow multiple transactions (buy and sell on different days) or just a single transaction (buy once, sell later).

### Problem Recap

Given an array `prices`, where `prices[i]` represents the price of a stock on the `i`th day, you need to determine the maximum profit you can achieve by buying and selling the stock at most once. If no profit can be made, return `0`.

### 1. **Brute Force Solution**

```javascript
function maxProfit1(prices) {
  let globalProfit = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
      const currentProfit = prices[j] - prices[i];

      if (currentProfit > globalProfit) globalProfit = currentProfit;
    }
  }

  return globalProfit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Idea:** This approach uses two nested loops to evaluate every possible pair of days and calculates the profit. If a greater profit is found, it is stored in `globalProfit`.
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n^2)**, as there are two nested loops, making it inefficient for large arrays.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)**, as no extra data structures are used other than variables for the loop.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(maxProfit1([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])); // Output: 5 (Buy at 1, Sell at 6)
```

---

### 2. **Greedy Algorithm (Single Pass)**

```javascript
const maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let minStockPurchasePrice = prices[0] || 0;
  let profit = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] < minStockPurchasePrice) {
      minStockPurchasePrice = prices[i];
    }

    profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - minStockPurchasePrice);
  }

  return profit;
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Idea:** This solution keeps track of the minimum price encountered so far (`minStockPurchasePrice`) and updates the profit if selling at the current price gives a higher profit than the previous maximum.
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, as we only loop through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)**, as we use only a few variables to track the minimum price and profit.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])); // Output: 5
```

---

### 3. **Alternative Version of the Greedy Approach**

```javascript
function maxProfit(prices) {
  let minPrice = Infinity;
  let maxProfit = 0;

  for (let price of prices) {
    minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
    maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
  }

  return maxProfit;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Idea:** This is another variant of the greedy approach that also tracks the minimum price and calculates the maximum profit.
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, as we only loop through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)**, as we use only a few variables to track the minimum price and profit.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])); // Output: 5
```

---

### 4. **Optimized Solution with Map-based Track of Minimum Price**

```javascript
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let ans = 0;
  let mi = prices[0];
  for (const v of prices) {
      ans = Math.max(ans, v - mi);
      mi = Math.min(mi, v);
  }
  return ans;
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Idea:** This solution tracks the minimum price (`mi`) and iterates through the array once, calculating the potential profit at each price and updating the maximum profit if needed.
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, as we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)**, as we use a few variables to track the minimum price and profit.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])); // Output: 5
```

### 5. **Allowing Multiple Transactions (Max Profit with Multiple Buy/Sell Operations)**

If you are allowed to perform multiple buy and sell transactions (i.e., you can buy and sell on different days, even the same day), the problem changes slightly.

```javascript
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let ans = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
      ans += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
  }
  return ans;
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Idea:** This solution allows you to make multiple transactions. If the price on day `i` is higher than the price on day `i-1`, it adds the difference to the total profit, as this represents a profitable transaction. If the price on day `i` is lower than the price on day `i-1`, it doesn't perform any transaction (i.e., `Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i-1])` ensures no negative profit is added).
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, as we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)**, as we use only a few variables for tracking profit.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4])); // Output: 7 (Buy at 1, sell at 5. Buy at 3, sell at 6. Total = 4 + 3 = 7)
console.log(maxProfit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 4 (Buy at 1, sell at 5. Total = 4)
console.log(maxProfit([7, 6, 4, 3, 1])); // Output: 0 (No transactions)
```

### Time and Space Complexity Comparison

| Approach                                | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Brute Force**                         | **O(n^2)**       | **O(1)**          |
| **Greedy (Single Transaction)**        | **O(n)**         | **O(1)**          |
| **Greedy (Multiple Transactions)**     | **O(n)**         | **O(1)**          |
| **Optimized with Map for Min Price**   | **O(n)**         | **O(1)**          |

- **Brute Force:** **O(n^2)** time complexity, making it impractical for large inputs.
- **Greedy and Optimized Solutions:** All greedy solutions run in **O(n)** time and use **O(1)** space, making them efficient.

---

### Conclusion:

- **For the single transaction case:** The greedy approach is the best solution with **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space complexity.
- **For multiple transactions:** The greedy approach that accumulates profit as long as the price increases also works well with **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space complexity.

These solutions are efficient and scalable for large input sizes, and the greedy approach is optimal for this problem.
