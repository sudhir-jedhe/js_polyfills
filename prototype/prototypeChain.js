// **Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.

// The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or **\_\_proto\_\_** property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through **Object.prototype**.
