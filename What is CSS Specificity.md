**What is CSS Specificity?**
CSS specificity is a rule that determines which CSS styles are applied to an element when multiple conflicting rules target the same element. Itâ€™s a way of calculating the "weight" of CSS selectors, and it helps the browser decide which style rule to apply when multiple rules could affect the same element.

In simple terms, CSS specificity defines the priority of CSS selectors, ensuring that more specific selectors override more general ones.

**How CSS Specificity Works**
Specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used in a CSS rule. The more specific the selector, the higher its specificity score. The specificity score is calculated as a set of four values, often represented as a tuple:

```js
(a, b, c, d)
```
Where:

`a represents the number of inline styles applied to an element.`
`b represents the number of IDs used in the selector.`
`c represents the number of classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes used in the selector.`
`d represents the number of element (type) selectors and pseudo-elements used in the selector`.

**CSS Specificity Formula**
The specificity of a CSS rule is calculated based on these components, with the following priority order:

**Inline styles (a value)**
**ID selectors (b value)**
**Class, attribute, and pseudo-class selectors (c value)**
**Type selectors (element selectors) and pseudo-elements (d value)**

The specificity score is evaluated by comparing these four values in the order above. If two selectors have the same specificity, the one that appears last in the stylesheet will be applied.

**CSS Specificity Breakdown**
`Inline styles`: If you apply a style directly to an element using the style attribute, it has the highest specificity (i.e., a = 1).

```js
<div style="color: red;">Hello World</div>
```

`ID selectors:` Selectors with IDs are more specific than class or type selectors. The specificity of an ID selector is represented as b = 1.

```js
#header { color: blue; }
```

`Class selectors:` Selectors using classes have lower specificity than ID selectors. The specificity of a class selector is represented as c = 1.

```js
.menu { color: green; }
```

`Type (element) selectors:` These selectors have the lowest specificity. The specificity of a type selector is represented as d = 1.

```js
p { color: yellow; }
```
`Pseudo-classes: Pseudo-classes` (like :hover, :first-child, etc.) have a specificity that is the same as class selectors.

```js
p:hover { color: pink; }
```

`Pseudo-elements: Pseudo-elements` (like ::before, ::after) also contribute to specificity but are considered to have the same weight as type selectors.

```js
p::before { content: "Hello"; }
```

**Examples of Specificity Calculation
Example 1: Inline style vs CSS rule**
```js
<!-- Inline style has highest specificity -->
<div id="header" style="color: red;">Hello World</div>
```
```js
#header {
  color: blue;
}
```
Inline style (style="color: red;") has the highest specificity: (1, 0, 0, 0)
The CSS rule #header has a specificity of (0, 1, 0, 0)
**Result:** The text will be red because the inline style has higher specificity than the #header ID selector.

**Example 2: ID vs Class vs Type selectors**
```js
/* ID selector */
#header {
  color: blue;
}

/* Class selector */
.menu {
  color: green;
}

/* Type selector */
p {
  color: yellow;
}
```
```js
<p class="menu" id="header">Hello World</p>
```
The #header selector has specificity (0, 1, 0, 0).
The .menu selector has specificity (0, 0, 1, 0).
The p selector has specificity (0, 0, 0, 1).
Result: The text will be blue because the #header ID selector has the highest specificity.

**Example 3: Pseudo-class selector vs Type selector**
```js
/* Type selector */
p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Pseudo-class selector */
p:hover {
  color: red;
}

```
```js
<p>Hover over me</p>
```
The p selector has specificity (0, 0, 0, 1).
The p:hover selector has specificity (0, 0, 1, 1) (higher specificity than the p selector).
Result: When you hover over the paragraph, the text will be red because the p:hover selector has higher specificity than the p selector.

**Summary of Specificity Rules**
**Inline styles: Highest specificity.**
Specificity: (1, 0, 0, 0)
**ID selectors: Next highest specificity.**
Specificity: (0, 1, 0, 0)
**Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: Medium specificity.**
Specificity: (0, 0, 1, 0)
**Type (element) selectors and pseudo-elements: Lowest specificity.**
Specificity: (0, 0, 0, 1)

CSS Specificity Example Order
If you have the following selectors, the order of application based on specificity will be:

`Inline style` (most specific)
`ID selectors`
`Class selectors, pseudo-classes`
`Type selectors, pseudo-elements` (least specific)


**Conclusion**
Understanding CSS specificity is crucial when you're dealing with conflicting styles, especially in large projects with multiple CSS rules targeting the same elements. By knowing how specificity works, you can avoid issues with styles not applying as expected and ensure your stylesheets are both efficient and maintainable.
