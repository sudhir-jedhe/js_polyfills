// GIT PULL REQUESTS Explained

// Pull Requests (PRs) are essential for team-based development, helping to streamline code collaboration and reviews.

// Here’s a breakdown of the PR process:

// Developer Workflow 🧑‍💻:
// Developers start by cloning the project repository and creating a new branch for their feature.
// They make commits and push their changes, and then open a Pull Request (PR) for review.

// Review Process 🔍:
// The PR is reviewed by team members, and comments or feedback may be provided.
// If necessary, developers address feedback and push updates until the review passes.

// Judging and Merging ⚖️:
// The PR is either approved and merged into the main branch, or it is rejected.
// Upon merging, the feature branch code becomes part of the main codebase.

// This flow ensures code quality, collaboration, and a smooth integration process. It’s the backbone of continuous integration in modern software projects!
