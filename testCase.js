// Pro tip: When you find an issue, first write a test case that replicates the issue, and only afterward start fixing it.

// Not only does the test prove whether the fix is working, but it will also help you avoid a regression on the same issue in the future.

// In the world of software development, encountering bugs and issues is inevitable. But what sets great developers apart is not just their ability to fix problems, but their approach to doing so. 

// One powerful strategy that can significantly enhance your debugging process is writing test cases. 

// Let's see why this way is so useful and how it can totally change how you work on your projects:

// Imagine you encounter an issue in your code.
// Your first instinct might be to dive straight into fixing it. However, seasoned developers know that there's a more effective approach writing test cases.

// 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼 𝘁𝗶𝗽 𝗶𝘀 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝘆𝗲𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱: When you encounter an issue, start by crafting a test case that replicates the problem. Only after you have a comprehensive test in place should you begin the process of fixing the issue.

// 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱? 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗳𝗼𝗹𝗱: 
// By creating a test case that replicates the issue, you gain a clear understanding of the problem's scope and nature.

// Writing a test case serves as a safeguard against future regressions. Once you've fixed the issue, the test case acts as a permanent checkpoint. If the issue ever resurfaces due to subsequent code changes, the test will catch it, alerting you to the regression before it becomes a significant problem.

// Implementing this strategy is straightforward. Whenever you encounter a bug or issue, resist the urge to rush into fixing it immediately. Instead, take a step back and think about how you can construct a test case that reproduces the problem reliably.

// So, the next time you encounter a bug, remember the pro tip: Write a test case first, fix later.
