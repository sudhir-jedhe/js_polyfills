### The Event Loop and Task Queues in JavaScript

JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one operation at a time. However, JavaScript is also asynchronous, allowing it to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main thread. This is where the **Event Loop** and the two types of task queues—**Microtask Queue** and **Macrotask Queue**—come into play.

#### The Key Components

1. **Call Stack**:
   - The **Call Stack** is where all the functions get executed in JavaScript.
   - It is a **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** structure: the last function added to the stack is the first one to execute.
   - When a function is called, it gets pushed onto the stack. When the function finishes, it gets popped off.

2. **Task Queues**:
   - There are two types of queues where tasks (functions) wait to be executed after they are scheduled asynchronously: **Microtask Queue** and **Macrotask Queue**.

   - **Microtask Queue**: 
     - It is a queue for **microtasks** like promise `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`.
     - Microtasks have **higher priority** over macrotasks and are processed immediately after the current task is completed and before any rendering.

   - **Macrotask Queue**: 
     - It is a queue for **macrotasks** like `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, `requestAnimationFrame()`, and other I/O-related tasks.
     - Macrotasks are processed after microtasks have been completed.

3. **Event Loop**:
   - The **Event Loop** continuously checks the **Call Stack** and the **Task Queues**.
   - If the Call Stack is empty, the event loop first processes all **Microtasks** in the Microtask Queue, and then processes the **Macrotasks** in the Macrotask Queue.
   - It runs in cycles, ensuring that asynchronous tasks are executed in the right order and that the main thread doesn't get blocked.

#### Example Breakdown

Here’s the JavaScript code snippet you provided and how it works step-by-step:

```javascript
console.log(1);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(2);
}, 100);

requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  console.log(3);
});

requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  console.log(4);
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(5);
  }, 10);
});

const end = Date.now() + 200;
while (Date.now() < end) {}

console.log(6);
```

#### Step-by-step Execution:

1. **`console.log(1)`**:
   - This is a synchronous operation. It is pushed onto the **Call Stack** and executed immediately.
   - Output: `1`.

2. **`setTimeout(() => { console.log(2); }, 100);`**:
   - This schedules a macrotask to log `2` after 100ms. The callback is added to the **Macrotask Queue**, but it won't run until the current script execution is finished and all microtasks are processed.

3. **`requestAnimationFrame(() => { console.log(3); });`**:
   - `requestAnimationFrame` schedules a macrotask to execute the callback in the next animation frame. The callback is added to the **Macrotask Queue** but is prioritized to run before `setTimeout`.

4. **`requestAnimationFrame(() => { console.log(4); setTimeout(() => { console.log(5); }, 10); });`**:
   - Another `requestAnimationFrame` schedules another macrotask. It will log `4` first, then schedules a **setTimeout** with a 10ms delay to log `5`. The timeout callback gets placed in the **Macrotask Queue**.

5. **`const end = Date.now() + 200; while (Date.now() < end) {}`**:
   - This is a **blocking synchronous operation** that keeps the **Call Stack** occupied for 200ms, preventing the event loop from checking the task queues.

6. **`console.log(6)`**:
   - After the blocking operation finishes, `console.log(6)` is executed, as it's still part of the synchronous code.

### Understanding the Execution Order:

Let's look at the output sequence.

1. `1` is printed first because it's a synchronous operation.
2. The while loop runs and blocks the thread for 200ms, during which no other tasks can execute.
3. After the loop, `6` is printed.
4. Now, the **Event Loop** will start processing the tasks in the queue:
   - The two `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks (logging `3` and `4`) are **macrotasks** and will be executed before the `setTimeout` callbacks.
   - Therefore, `3` and `4` are printed.
5. `setTimeout` for logging `5` is executed last, since it's in the **Macrotask Queue**.

#### Output:

```text
1
6
3
4
2
5
```

### Explanation of Task Queue Priorities:

- **Microtasks** (like promises and mutations) have higher priority than **Macrotasks** (like `setTimeout()`).
- The **Microtask Queue** is processed **before** the **Macrotask Queue**, even if the microtasks were added after the macrotasks.
- Even though `setTimeout` is set to 0ms, it will only run after the current script execution (and any microtasks) completes, which means it will run **after** all the `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks.

### Event Loop Summary:

- **Script Execution**: JavaScript starts executing synchronously until the call stack is empty.
- **Microtasks**: After the current task finishes, JavaScript processes all microtasks before continuing to macrotasks.
- **Macrotasks**: Once microtasks are processed, JavaScript moves on to processing macrotasks like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `requestAnimationFrame`.

#### The Priority of Queues:

1. **Call Stack**: The first place where functions are executed.
2. **Microtask Queue**: Microtasks (e.g., Promises) are processed first, before macrotasks.
3. **Macrotask Queue**: Macrotasks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`) are processed after all microtasks are done.
4. **Rendering**: UI updates happen in between tasks (though not during the microtask execution).

### Important Notes:
- The second argument of `setTimeout()` only specifies the minimum delay. It doesn’t guarantee that the callback will execute exactly after the specified time, as it will depend on when the event loop reaches the **Macrotask Queue**.
- `requestAnimationFrame()` callbacks are part of the **Macrotask Queue** but run **before** `setTimeout()` or other macrotasks.

This breakdown helps clarify how JavaScript schedules and executes different types of tasks in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner using the Event Loop, **Microtask Queue**, and **Macrotask Queue**.



In JavaScript, the event loop and task queue mechanism determine the order in which different asynchronous tasks are executed, including `Promises` and `setTimeout`. The priority of `Promises` over `setTimeout` arises due to how the JavaScript runtime handles the event loop and task queues, specifically **microtasks** and **macrotasks**. Let's break down the reasons why Promises get higher priority than `setTimeout`:

### 1. **Microtasks and Macrotasks:**

   - **Microtasks** are tasks that are scheduled to be executed after the currently executing script completes and before the next event loop iteration begins. Promises (via `Promise.then()` or `Promise.catch()`) are handled in the **microtask queue**.
   - **Macrotasks** are tasks like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and I/O tasks (e.g., network requests, DOM rendering). These tasks are handled in the **macrotask queue**.

### 2. **Event Loop Execution Order:**

   JavaScript uses an event loop that processes the call stack and then looks for tasks to execute. Here's how it works in general:

   1. **Execute any code in the call stack.**
   2. **Execute all the microtasks** that were scheduled (e.g., from resolved Promises).
   3. **Execute one macrotask** (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`).
   4. Repeat.

   Since microtasks (Promises) are processed **before** macrotasks (e.g., `setTimeout`), Promises get higher priority.

### 3. **Why Do Promises Get Higher Priority?**

   The priority of Promises over `setTimeout` can be attributed to the following points:

   - **Microtasks (Promises) are processed first**: When a Promise is resolved or rejected, the callback (e.g., `then()`, `catch()`) is queued in the microtask queue. The event loop ensures that all microtasks are processed before moving on to the next macrotask.
   
   - **Event loop design**: The event loop is designed to execute all microtasks before returning to macrotasks. This is done to avoid the potential for indefinite delay in processing Promise resolutions and to ensure that tasks such as UI updates (often triggered by Promises) are handled as soon as possible.

### 4. **Order of Execution Example:**

   Consider the following example:

   ```javascript
   console.log('Start');

   setTimeout(() => {
     console.log('setTimeout');
   }, 0);

   Promise.resolve().then(() => {
     console.log('Promise');
   });

   console.log('End');
   ```

   **Execution order:**
   1. `'Start'` is logged from the initial code execution.
   2. The `setTimeout` callback is added to the macrotask queue, but it doesn't run yet.
   3. The Promise is resolved immediately, and its `then()` callback is added to the microtask queue.
   4. `'End'` is logged from the initial code execution.
   5. All **microtasks** are executed now, so the `Promise` callback runs and `'Promise'` is logged.
   6. Finally, the event loop moves to the **macrotask queue** and executes the `setTimeout` callback, logging `'setTimeout'`.

   **Output:**
   ```
   Start
   End
   Promise
   setTimeout
   ```

### 5. **Why Does This Matter?**

   The higher priority of Promises ensures that:
   
   - Promises are executed as soon as possible after the synchronous code has finished running, making the code more responsive.
   - Using Promises allows asynchronous logic (such as fetching data, handling user input, etc.) to be processed before other macrotasks like `setTimeout`, which may be used to delay certain actions.
   - This design ensures that promise resolutions do not get blocked or delayed by longer-running tasks, allowing for more efficient, predictable asynchronous behavior.

### 6. **SetTimeout and Delays:**

   Even if `setTimeout` is given a delay of `0ms`, it still has to wait for the current call stack to clear and for all microtasks (like Promises) to finish executing before it is executed.

### Conclusion:

To summarize, **Promises** get higher priority than **`setTimeout`** in JavaScript because Promises are handled in the **microtask queue**, which is processed before the **macrotask queue** (which handles tasks like `setTimeout`). This ensures that Promises are resolved as soon as possible after the synchronous code execution, without being delayed by macrotasks.
