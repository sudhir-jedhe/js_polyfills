### The Event Loop and Task Queues in JavaScript

JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one operation at a time. However, JavaScript is also asynchronous, allowing it to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main thread. This is where the **Event Loop** and the two types of task queues—**Microtask Queue** and **Macrotask Queue**—come into play.

#### The Key Components

1. **Call Stack**:
   - The **Call Stack** is where all the functions get executed in JavaScript.
   - It is a **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** structure: the last function added to the stack is the first one to execute.
   - When a function is called, it gets pushed onto the stack. When the function finishes, it gets popped off.

2. **Task Queues**:
   - There are two types of queues where tasks (functions) wait to be executed after they are scheduled asynchronously: **Microtask Queue** and **Macrotask Queue**.

   - **Microtask Queue**: 
     - It is a queue for **microtasks** like promise `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`.
     - Microtasks have **higher priority** over macrotasks and are processed immediately after the current task is completed and before any rendering.

   - **Macrotask Queue**: 
     - It is a queue for **macrotasks** like `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, `requestAnimationFrame()`, and other I/O-related tasks.
     - Macrotasks are processed after microtasks have been completed.

3. **Event Loop**:
   - The **Event Loop** continuously checks the **Call Stack** and the **Task Queues**.
   - If the Call Stack is empty, the event loop first processes all **Microtasks** in the Microtask Queue, and then processes the **Macrotasks** in the Macrotask Queue.
   - It runs in cycles, ensuring that asynchronous tasks are executed in the right order and that the main thread doesn't get blocked.

#### Example Breakdown

Here’s the JavaScript code snippet you provided and how it works step-by-step:

```javascript
console.log(1);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(2);
}, 100);

requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  console.log(3);
});

requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  console.log(4);
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(5);
  }, 10);
});

const end = Date.now() + 200;
while (Date.now() < end) {}

console.log(6);
```

#### Step-by-step Execution:

1. **`console.log(1)`**:
   - This is a synchronous operation. It is pushed onto the **Call Stack** and executed immediately.
   - Output: `1`.

2. **`setTimeout(() => { console.log(2); }, 100);`**:
   - This schedules a macrotask to log `2` after 100ms. The callback is added to the **Macrotask Queue**, but it won't run until the current script execution is finished and all microtasks are processed.

3. **`requestAnimationFrame(() => { console.log(3); });`**:
   - `requestAnimationFrame` schedules a macrotask to execute the callback in the next animation frame. The callback is added to the **Macrotask Queue** but is prioritized to run before `setTimeout`.

4. **`requestAnimationFrame(() => { console.log(4); setTimeout(() => { console.log(5); }, 10); });`**:
   - Another `requestAnimationFrame` schedules another macrotask. It will log `4` first, then schedules a **setTimeout** with a 10ms delay to log `5`. The timeout callback gets placed in the **Macrotask Queue**.

5. **`const end = Date.now() + 200; while (Date.now() < end) {}`**:
   - This is a **blocking synchronous operation** that keeps the **Call Stack** occupied for 200ms, preventing the event loop from checking the task queues.

6. **`console.log(6)`**:
   - After the blocking operation finishes, `console.log(6)` is executed, as it's still part of the synchronous code.

### Understanding the Execution Order:

Let's look at the output sequence.

1. `1` is printed first because it's a synchronous operation.
2. The while loop runs and blocks the thread for 200ms, during which no other tasks can execute.
3. After the loop, `6` is printed.
4. Now, the **Event Loop** will start processing the tasks in the queue:
   - The two `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks (logging `3` and `4`) are **macrotasks** and will be executed before the `setTimeout` callbacks.
   - Therefore, `3` and `4` are printed.
5. `setTimeout` for logging `5` is executed last, since it's in the **Macrotask Queue**.

#### Output:

```text
1
6
3
4
2
5
```

### Explanation of Task Queue Priorities:

- **Microtasks** (like promises and mutations) have higher priority than **Macrotasks** (like `setTimeout()`).
- The **Microtask Queue** is processed **before** the **Macrotask Queue**, even if the microtasks were added after the macrotasks.
- Even though `setTimeout` is set to 0ms, it will only run after the current script execution (and any microtasks) completes, which means it will run **after** all the `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks.

### Event Loop Summary:

- **Script Execution**: JavaScript starts executing synchronously until the call stack is empty.
- **Microtasks**: After the current task finishes, JavaScript processes all microtasks before continuing to macrotasks.
- **Macrotasks**: Once microtasks are processed, JavaScript moves on to processing macrotasks like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `requestAnimationFrame`.

#### The Priority of Queues:

1. **Call Stack**: The first place where functions are executed.
2. **Microtask Queue**: Microtasks (e.g., Promises) are processed first, before macrotasks.
3. **Macrotask Queue**: Macrotasks (e.g., `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`) are processed after all microtasks are done.
4. **Rendering**: UI updates happen in between tasks (though not during the microtask execution).

### Important Notes:
- The second argument of `setTimeout()` only specifies the minimum delay. It doesn’t guarantee that the callback will execute exactly after the specified time, as it will depend on when the event loop reaches the **Macrotask Queue**.
- `requestAnimationFrame()` callbacks are part of the **Macrotask Queue** but run **before** `setTimeout()` or other macrotasks.

This breakdown helps clarify how JavaScript schedules and executes different types of tasks in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner using the Event Loop, **Microtask Queue**, and **Macrotask Queue**.
