The function `checkStraightLine` is designed to check if a series of points (represented as pairs of coordinates) lie on the same straight line. It uses the concept of **slope** to determine if the points are collinear.

### Explanation of the Function:

1. **Edge Case - Less than 3 Points**:
   - If the number of points is less than or equal to 2, the function returns `true` because two points always form a straight line by definition.
   
2. **Initial Slope Calculation**:
   - The slope between the first two points (i.e., the first two coordinates) is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{slope} = \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0}
     \]
     This gives the slope between the first two points.

3. **Checking the Slope for Remaining Points**:
   - The function then iterates over the rest of the points. For each point, it calculates the slope between the first point and the current point.
   - If at any point the slope is not the same as the initial slope, it returns `false` because this means the points are not collinear.
   
4. **Return Value**:
   - If all points form the same slope as the first two, the function returns `true` indicating that the points are collinear and lie on a straight line.

### Key Consideration:
- The function might encounter a **divide by zero** issue if any two points have the same x-coordinate (i.e., a vertical line). This needs to be handled, especially for vertical lines where the slope would be undefined.

### Improved Version with Handling for Vertical Lines:

To handle the special case of vertical lines, we can modify the function to use a more reliable check for equality without directly comparing floating-point values:

```javascript
function checkStraightLine(coordinates) {
    if (coordinates.length <= 2) {
        return true; // If only two points, they always form a straight line
    }

    const [x0, y0] = coordinates[0];
    const [x1, y1] = coordinates[1];

    // Calculate the differences (delta) for x and y between the first two points
    const dx = x1 - x0;
    const dy = y1 - y0;

    for (let i = 2; i < coordinates.length; i++) {
        const [x, y] = coordinates[i];

        // Check if the cross multiplication gives the same slope for each point
        if (dy * (x - x0) !== dx * (y - y0)) {
            return false; // Points do not form a straight line
        }
    }

    return true; // All points form a straight line
}

// Test case
console.log(checkStraightLine([[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7]])); // Output: true
console.log(checkStraightLine([[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]])); // Output: true
console.log(checkStraightLine([[1,1],[2,2],[3,4]])); // Output: false
```

### Explanation of the Improved Code:

1. **Cross Multiplication**:
   - Instead of directly calculating and comparing slopes (which might lead to precision issues with floating-point arithmetic), we use **cross multiplication**:
     \[
     (y_2 - y_1) \times (x_3 - x_1) = (x_2 - x_1) \times (y_3 - y_1)
     \]
     This avoids division and helps in comparing whether the slopes are equal by comparing the products of differences in `x` and `y` for each pair of points.
   
2. **Benefits**:
   - This approach works correctly even for vertical lines (where `dx` would be 0), and avoids potential issues with floating-point precision when comparing slopes.
   
### Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**

   ```javascript
   console.log(checkStraightLine([[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7]])); // true
   ```

   This should return `true` because all points form a straight line with a slope of 1.

2. **Test Case 2:**

   ```javascript
   console.log(checkStraightLine([[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]])); // true
   ```

   This should return `true` because the points lie on the line `y = x`.

3. **Test Case 3:**

   ```javascript
   console.log(checkStraightLine([[1,1],[2,2],[3,4]])); // false
   ```

   This should return `false` because the points don't lie on the same straight line.

4. **Test Case 4 (Vertical Line):**

   ```javascript
   console.log(checkStraightLine([[1,1],[1,2],[1,3]])); // true
   ```

   This should return `true` because all the points lie on a vertical line where `x = 1`.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of points. We only iterate once through the points to check the slope condition.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a few variables to track the coordinates and differences.

This solution efficiently checks if a set of points lie on a straight line while handling both horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines correctly.
