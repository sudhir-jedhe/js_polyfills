Given an array A[] of n-elements. We need to select two adjacent elements and 
delete the larger of them and store smaller of them to another array say B[]. 
We need to perform this operation till array A[] contains only single element. 
Finally, we have to construct the array B[] in such a way that total sum of 
its element is minimum. Print the total sum of array B[]
