Finding the most frequent element in an array can be useful in many scenarios. The good news is that it's fairly easy to implement both for primitive and object values using JavaScript's array methods.

ðŸ’¬  Note
If you want to find the frequency of each value in an array instead, check how to group and count values in a JavaScript array.

Most frequent element in an array of primitives
Primitive values are easy to compare and count the frequency of. All you have to do is use Array.prototype.reduce() to create an object with the unique values of the array as keys and their frequencies as values.

Notice how you can use the nullish coalescing operator (??) to initialize the value of each key to 0 if it doesn't exist and increment it by 1 every time the same value is encountered.

Finally, you can use Object.entries() and Array.prototype.reduce() again to find the most frequent value.

const mostFrequent = arr =>
  Object.entries(
    arr.reduce((a, v) => {
      a[v] = (a[v] ?? 0) + 1;
      return a;
    }, {})
  ).reduce((a, v) => (v[1] >= a[1] ? v : a), [null, 0])[0];

mostFrequent(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'b']); // 'a'
Most frequent element in an array of objects
When dealing with objects, you can use the same approach, but you'll need a mapping function to extract the value you want to compare. As primitive values can be compared using the === operator, you can provide a default mapping function that returns the value itself. This allows for the same implementation to work with both primitive and object values. Apart from this change, the implementation is the same.

const mostFrequent = (arr, mapFn = x => x) =>
  Object.entries(
    arr.reduce((a, v) => {
      const k = mapFn(v);
      a[k] = (a[k] ?? 0) + 1;
      return a;
    }, {})
  ).reduce((a, v) => (v[1] >= a[1] ? v : a), [null, 0])[0];

const people = [
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 28 },
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
];
mostFrequent(people, p => p.age); // '30'

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1];
mostFrequent(nums); // '1'
A more robust implementation, using Map
Both of the previous implementations suffer from the same issue: the resulting value is always a string, even if the original values were of a different type. To address this, you can use a Map to store the frequencies and then find the most frequent value, as keys in a Map can be of any type.

The only changes you need to make to the previous implementation is to create a Map as the accumulator of Array.prototype.reduce() and use Map.prototype.get() and Map.prototype.set() to interact with it. Finally, you can use the spread operator (...) to convert the Map to an array and find the most frequent value, instead of using Object.entries().

const mostFrequent = (arr, mapFn = x => x) =>
  [
    ...arr.reduce((a, v) => {
      const k = mapFn(v);
      a.set(k, (a.get(k) ?? 0) + 1);
      return a;
    }, new Map()),
  ].reduce((a, v) => (v[1] >= a[1] ? v : a), [null, 0])[0];

const people = [
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 28 },
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
];
mostFrequent(people, p => p.age); // 30

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1];
mostFrequent(nums); // 1
