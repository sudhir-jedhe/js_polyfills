// Input: S = “geeksforgeeks”
// Output: iiimugpsiiimu
// Explanation:
// Following changes are made on the string S:

// Frequency of ‘g’ is 2. Therefore, shifting the character ‘g’ by 2 becomes ‘i’.
// Frequency of ‘e’ is 4. Therefore, shifting the character ‘e’ by 4 becomes ‘i’.
// Frequency of ‘k’ is 2. Therefore, shifting the character ‘k’ by 2 becomes ‘m’.
// Frequency of ‘s’ is 2. Therefore, shifting the character ‘s’ by 2 becomes ‘u’.
// Frequency of ‘f’ is 1. Therefore, shifting the character ‘f’ by 1 becomes ‘g’.
// Frequency of ‘o’ is 1. Therefore, shifting the character ‘o’ by 1 becomes ‘p’.
// Frequency of ‘r’ is 1. Therefore, shifting the character ‘r’ by 1 becomes ‘s’.
// After the above shifting of characters, the string modifies to “iiimugpsiiimu”.

// Input: S = “aabcadb”
// Output: ddddded
