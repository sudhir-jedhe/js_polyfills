/*
Input: S = “geeks”
Output: hgglt
Explanation: 
The following modifications are done on the string S:

The frequency of ‘g’ in the string is 1. Therefore, ‘g’ is replaced by ‘h’.
The frequency of ‘e’ in the string is 2. Therefore, ‘e’ is replaced by ‘g’.
The frequency of ‘e’ in the string is 2. Therefore, ‘e’ is replaced by ‘g’.
The frequency of ‘k’ in the string is 1. Therefore, ‘k’ is converted to ‘k’ + 1 = ‘l’.
The frequency of ‘s’ in the string is 1. Therefore, ‘s’ is converted to ‘s’ + 1 = ‘t’.
Therefore, the modified string S is “hgglt”.

Input: S = “jazz”
Output: “kbbb”
