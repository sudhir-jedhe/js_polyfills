## Web Vitals: The Performance Metrics

**Web Vitals** are a set of metrics defined by [Google Chrome Developers](https://web.dev/vitals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to measure the real-world user experience of a website.

They help answer questions like:

- How fast does the page load?
- How quickly can users interact with it?
- Does the page layout shift unexpectedly?

These metrics are important for:

- User experience (UX)
- SEO and search rankings
- Performance optimization
- React application monitoring

---

## Core Web Vitals

### 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

**Measures:** Loading performance.

**What it tracks:**
The time taken for the largest visible content element (image, heading, banner, etc.) to appear on the screen.

#### Good Score

- ✅ Good: ≤ 2.5 seconds
- ⚠️ Needs Improvement: 2.5–4 seconds
- ❌ Poor: > 4 seconds

#### React Example

Suppose a product page loads:

```text
Navbar
Hero Image
Product Details
Footer
```

If the Hero Image is the largest element, LCP measures how long it takes to render.

#### Improve LCP

- Optimize images
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Reduce bundle size
- Use CDN
- Enable caching
- Server-side rendering (SSR)

---

### 2. Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

**Measures:** Responsiveness.

**What it tracks:**
How quickly the page responds to user interactions such as:

- Clicks
- Taps
- Keyboard input

#### Good Score

- ✅ Good: ≤ 200 ms
- ⚠️ Needs Improvement: 200–500 ms
- ❌ Poor: > 500 ms

#### React Example

User clicks:

```jsx
<button onClick={handleCheckout}>Checkout</button>
```

If React blocks the main thread with heavy calculations before updating the UI, INP becomes poor.

#### Improve INP

- Use `React.memo`
- Use `useMemo`
- Use `useCallback`
- Virtualize long lists
- Split large components
- Avoid expensive renders

---

### 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

**Measures:** Visual stability.

**What it tracks:**
Unexpected layout movement while the page is loading.

#### Good Score

- ✅ Good: ≤ 0.1
- ⚠️ Needs Improvement: 0.1–0.25
- ❌ Poor: > 0.25

#### Example

User tries to click:

```text
[Buy Now]
```

Suddenly an advertisement loads above it and pushes the button down.

This creates layout shift.

#### Improve CLS

- Set image dimensions
- Reserve space for ads
- Avoid inserting content above existing content
- Use skeleton loaders

---

## Additional Web Vitals

### First Contentful Paint (FCP)

Measures when the first visible content appears.

```text
Page request
↓
First text/image displayed
```

Good: < 1.8 seconds

---

### Time to First Byte (TTFB)

Measures server response speed.

```text
Browser Request
↓
Server Response Starts
```

Good: < 800 ms

---

## Web Vitals in React

React projects created with Create React App traditionally included:

```jsx
reportWebVitals();
```

Example:

```jsx
import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals";

reportWebVitals(console.log);
```

This logs metrics such as:

- LCP
- INP
- CLS

You can send them to analytics tools for monitoring.

## Interview Answer

> Web Vitals are Google's user-centric performance metrics that measure loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability. The three Core Web Vitals are Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). In React applications, these metrics help identify slow renders, heavy JavaScript execution, large bundles, and layout instability. Improving Web Vitals leads to a better user experience, better SEO performance, and faster, more responsive applications.

Here are **React Web Vitals interview questions** ranging from beginner to advanced level, including real-world scenarios often asked in frontend interviews.

---

### 2. What are the three Core Web Vitals?

**Answer:**

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** – Loading performance
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)** – Responsiveness (replaced FID)
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** – Visual stability

---

### 3. What is Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)?

**Answer:**
LCP measures how long it takes for the largest visible content element (image, text block, video poster) to render.

**Good:** ≤ 2.5 seconds

---

### 4. What is Interaction to Next Paint (INP)?

**Answer:**
INP measures the time between a user interaction (click, tap, key press) and the next visual update on the screen.

**Good:** ≤ 200 ms

---

### 5. What is Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)?
