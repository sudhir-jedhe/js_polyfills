*** copy Test-Driven Development (TDD).md ***

In **Front-End System Design**, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is an iterative software development methodology where developers write automated tests *before* writing the actual application code.

Instead of treating testing as an afterthought, TDD flips the traditional workflow on its head: **tests dictate the design, structure, and behavior of the system**.

When applied to front-end architecture, TDD acts as an architectural design tool. It prevents over-engineering, enforces clear component boundaries, ensures loose coupling from API backends, and guarantees that user interface state transitions are fully deterministic.

## 1. The Core TDD Cycle: "Red-Green-Refactor"

TDD relies on a short, repeating feedback loop composed of three steps:

```
            ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
            │                                         │
            ▼                                         │
  ┌──────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─┴────────────────┐
  │   1. RED         │     │   2. GREEN       │     │   3. REFACTOR    │
  │ Write a failing  │ ──► │ Write minimal    │ ──► │ Clean up code    │
  │ test for behavior│     │ code to pass test│     │ without breaking │
  └──────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘

```

1. **🔴 Red:** Write a tiny automated test describing a desired feature or user interaction *before* writing the UI component. Run the test and watch it fail (proving that the test is valid and not passing false positives).
2. **🟢 Green:** Write the absolute minimum amount of application/UI code required to make the test pass. Do not write extra features or premature optimizations at this stage.
3. **🔵 Refactor:** Clean up the codebase—eliminate duplicate logic, extract utility functions, improve component composition, or rename variables. Run tests continuously to ensure no functionality is broken during cleanup.

## 2. Core Principles of TDD in Front-End Architecture

### Principle 1: Test Behavior, Not Implementation Details

In front-end applications, components undergo frequent UI restyling and framework refactoring. TDD requires testing **what the user sees and experiences** rather than *how* the component is internally constructed.

* **❌ Implementation Detail:** Checking if `wrapper.state('isOpen')` is `true`.
* **✅ Behavioral Focus:** Checking if `screen.getByRole('dialog')` is visible in the DOM after clicking the trigger button.

### Principle 2: Contract-First Component Design

Before writing JSX or styles, TDD forces you to define the component’s **interface contract**:

* What props or contexts does this component accept?
* What accessible DOM events (`onClick`, `onSubmit`) must it fire?
* How does it handle async API loading, success, and failure states?

### Principle 3: Isolating Side-Effects via Mocking

Front-end components frequently deal with network requests, browser storage (`localStorage`), and routing. TDD requires isolating UI components from external side effects using mock layers (such as **Mock Service Worker / MSW** for APIs) so tests run deterministically in Node.js environments.

## 3. Practical Example: Building a React Component with TDD

Imagine we need to build a `Counter` component that increments a count when a button is clicked.

### Step 1: RED (Write the failing test first)

```tsx
// src/components/__tests__/Counter.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { Counter } from '../Counter';

describe('Counter Component (TDD)', () => {
  it('renders initial count and increments when button is clicked', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    // 1. Render component (Component doesn't exist yet -> RED)
    render(<Counter initialCount={5} />);

    // 2. Assert initial value
    expect(screen.getByText(/count: 5/i)).toBeInTheDocument();

    // 3. Simulate user click
    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /increment/i });
    await user.click(button);

    // 4. Assert updated value
    expect(screen.getByText(/count: 6/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});

```

*Running `npm test` fails immediately because `Counter` does not exist yet.*

---

### Step 2: GREEN (Write minimal code to pass)

```tsx
// src/components/Counter.tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export const Counter: React.FC<{ initialCount?: number }> = ({ initialCount = 0 }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

```

*Running `npm test` passes immediately with green checks.*

---

### Step 3: REFACTOR (Clean up code without fear)

Now you can extract logic into custom hooks (e.g., `useCounter`), optimize performance, or apply Tailwind/CSS classes. Because the test suite is running, you get instant feedback if a refactor breaks existing functionality.

## 4. Advantages of TDD as a Foundational Approach in Front-End System Design

| Advantage                               | Architectural Impact                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prevents Over-Engineering**           | Developers write **only** the code required to satisfy the failing test, preventing bloat, unnecessary state abstractions, and unused features.                                                                    |
| **Enforces Accessible & Semantic HTML** | Because testing libraries (like React Testing Library) query elements by accessibility roles (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`), TDD naturally forces developers to write accessible, WCAG-compliant semantic markup. |
| **Enables Aggressive Refactoring**      | Front-end libraries and state managers evolve rapidly. TDD creates a comprehensive safety net, allowing teams to upgrade frameworks or rewrite internal component logic with 100% confidence.                      |
| **Improves Component Decoupling**       | Writing tests first makes tightly-coupled code immediately painful to write. It forces developers to extract business logic into pure utility functions or custom hooks, keeping UI components lightweight.        |
| **Executable Documentation**            | The test suite serves as living, always-up-to-date documentation. New developers can read the `.test.tsx` files to understand exactly how a component or system module is supposed to behave under all edge cases. |
| **Reduces Production Regression Costs** | Catching bugs in the local Red-Green-Refactor loop is vastly cheaper than catching bugs during QA testing, manual staging audits, or after deployment to production users.                                         |

## Summary

Applying TDD in Front-End System Design elevates tests from a manual QA checklist to a **blueprint for software architecture**. It leads to cleaner component boundaries, reliable state management, WCAG-compliant accessibility, and a codebase built for long-term maintainability.
