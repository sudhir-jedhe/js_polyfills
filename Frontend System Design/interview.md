1. How would you design a Responsive Web Application?
Responsive design allows a web application to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. During this discussion, focus on the following aspects:

Fluid Grid Layout: Use CSS grid or flexbox to create a layout that adjusts based on viewport size.
Media Queries: Implement media queries to apply different styles for different screen widths.
Responsive Images: Use the srcset attribute and picture element to deliver appropriate image resolutions based on device capabilities.
Example:

img src="small.jpg" srcset="medium.jpg 800w, large.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, 800px" alt="Responsive Image">
2. How would you implement Caching Strategies in a Frontend Application?
Caching is crucial for improving performance and reducing server load. Here are several strategies you can discuss:

Browser Caching: Utilize cache-control headers to instruct browsers on how long they should cache resources.
Service Workers: Implement service workers to set up caching strategies like Cache First, Network First, or Stale-While-Revalidate.
Local Storage: Store non-sensitive data in local storage to improve user experience on repeat visits.
Example of setting caching headers in HTTP response:

Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000
3. Design a Real-Time Chat Application
Building a real-time chat application requires consideration of both frontend architecture and backend technology. When discussing this, consider:

WebSockets: Implement WebSocket for real-time communication, allowing users to receive messages instantly.
React (or Vue): Use a reactive framework to manage state efficiently and update the UI live as messages come in.
User Experience: Design a UI that handles typing indicators, message delivery statuses, and error handling gracefully.
Example of establishing a WebSocket connection:

const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/chat');
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // Update the chat interface
};
4. How would you handle Authentication in a Single Page Application (SPA)?
Authentication is fundamental for protecting user data. Here’s how to approach it:

Token-Based Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure communication and to manage user sessions.
Secure Storage: Store tokens securely in HTTP-only cookies or local storage depending on security requirements.
Route Protection: Utilize route guards in your application to restrict access to authenticated users only.
Example of intercepting API requests to include Authorization headers:

const authToken = localStorage.getItem('token');
fetch('/api/protected', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${authToken}`
    }
});
5. How do You Manage State in a Complex Frontend Application?
State management is crucial in applications where many components share or depend on state. Discuss the following options:

Context API: Use the Context API in React to manage global state without prop drilling.
State Management Libraries: Explore libraries like Redux or MobX for more complex scenarios requiring centralized state management.
Local Component State: Encourage the use of component-local state for less shared or transient data.
Example of using Redux to manage state:

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
