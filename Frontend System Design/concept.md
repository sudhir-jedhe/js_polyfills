**Frontend System Design Topics**

**1. Security and Accessibility**
- Authentication & Authorization: Secure user sessions and permissions. 
- CSRF & XSS Protection: Guard against malicious attacks. 
- CORS: Handle cross-origin requests securely. 
- Input Validation & Sanitization: Prevent user input vulnerabilities. 
- Subresource Integrity (SRI): Ensure third-party scripts havenâ€™t been tampered with. 
- Keyboard & Screen Reader Accessibility: Inclusive design for all users. 

 **2. Communication and Protocols** 
- REST APIs vs. GraphQL: Optimize how data flows to your app. 
- gRPC: Efficient communication for microservices. 
- WebRTC, WebSockets: Real-time communication. 
- HTTP Essentials: Headers, Methods, Status Codes, and Caching. 
- Request/Response Patterns: Ensure seamless communication. 

 **3. Performance Optimization** 
- Caching: In-memory caching, HTTP caching, and service worker caching. 
- Load Optimization: Long polling, short polling, and prioritization. 
- Build Optimization: Polyfills, tree shaking, and minification. 
- PWA (Progressive Web Apps): Offline support and performance. 
- React Optimization: State management and reducing re-renders. 

 **4. Data and Storage** 
- Database & Caching Overview: Backend dependencies matter. 
- Client Storage: Local storage, session storage, and IndexedDB. 
- Data Normalization: Handling structured data. 

 **5. Monitoring and Debugging** 
- Logging & Monitoring Overview: Diagnose issues proactively. 
- Telemetry: Collect actionable metrics. 
- E2E Testing & Unit Testing: Validate application integrity. 
- Debugging Strategies: Tools and best practices. 

 **6. Network and Infrastructure** 
- Infra Capacity: Handling scalability from the frontend perspective. 
- Networking Basics: TCP, UDP, and request prioritization. 
- Zero Downtime Deployment: Seamless updates without disruption. 

 **7. Design Systems and Frontend** Architectures 
- Design Systems: Reusable components and visual consistency. 
- Microfrontend: Splitting frontend monoliths into manageable pieces. 
- Feature Policy: Restrict features for better performance and security.
