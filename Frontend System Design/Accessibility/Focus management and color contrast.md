*** copy Focus management and color contrast.md ***

Focus management and color contrast are fundamental pillars of front-end architecture. Together, they dictate whether an application is usable by everyone—including people who rely on screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, switch devices, or have low vision or color vision deficiencies.

When treated as structural design requirements rather than post-development enhancements, they directly improve usability, accessibility, and overall product reliability.

## 1. Focus Management in Front-End Architecture

Focus management is the practice of controlling where the browser’s focus indicator (the active keyboard target) is positioned as users interact with a application.

### Why Focus Management Is Critical

* **Keyboard Navigation:** Users who cannot use a mouse (e.g., motor disabilities, power users) rely entirely on `Tab`, `Shift + Tab`, arrow keys, `Enter`, and `Space`. Without clear focus control, these users can become trapped or lose track of their position.
* **Screen Reader Orientation:** Assistive technologies announce whichever element currently holds DOM focus. If focus shifts unexpectedly or disappears, screen reader users lose context.
* **Single Page Application (SPA) Routing:** Standard multi-page applications trigger a complete browser reload on navigation, resetting focus to the top of the new document. SPAs replace DOM subtrees client-side, leaving focus stranded on unmounted elements unless explicitly managed.

### Core Focus Management Patterns

#### 1. Focus Trapping (Overlays & Dialogs)

When a modal, drawer, or dialog opens, focus must be contained inside that container until it is dismissed.

```
[ Trigger Button ] ──(Click)──► [ Modal Opens ]
                                      │
                                (Focus Moves)
                                      ▼
                      ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                      │ [X] Close (First Focus)      │
                      │ ┌──────────────────────────┐ │
                      │ │ Input Field              │ │
                      │ └──────────────────────────┘ │
                      │ [ Cancel ]   [ Submit ]      │
                      └──────────────┬───────────────┘
                                     │
                      (Tab key wraps from last to first)

```

* **Entry:** Shift focus to the first interactive element or the modal container itself.
* **Loop:** Intercept `Tab` on the last focusable element and loop it to the first focusable element (and vice versa for `Shift + Tab`).
* **Exit:** When closed via `Esc` or button click, return focus back to the original trigger element.

#### 2. SPA Route Transitions

Upon client-side navigation:

* Move focus to the top-level `<h1>` heading or the main landmark container (`<main>`).
* Ensure the target container has `tabIndex={-1}` so it can receive programmatic focus without entering the natural tab order.
* Dynamically update `document.title` so screen readers announce the new view name.

#### 3. Dynamic Content Injection & Deletions

* **Deletions:** If a user deletes an item from a list or table, move focus to the adjacent sibling or parent container—never let focus drop back to `document.body`.
* **Disclosures/Accordions:** Expanding a panel should reveal controls in the natural tab order immediately following the trigger button.

#### 4. Visible Focus Indicators

Never strip outline styles globally with `outline: none` or `outline: 0`. Always provide an explicit, high-contrast focus ring:

```css
/* Custom focus ring with sufficient contrast */
:focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid #0284c7; /* High-contrast primary color */
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

```

*Use `:focus-visible` instead of `:focus` so that focus rings appear for keyboard users while remaining hidden for mouse clicks.*

## 2. Color Contrast in Front-End Architecture

Color contrast refers to the difference in luminance (brightness) between foreground text/graphics and their background.

### Why Color Contrast Is Critical

* **Visual Impairments:** Millions of users live with low vision, cataract conditions, or various forms of color vision deficiency (protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia).
* **Environmental Factors:** Contrast affects everyone in low-visibility situations, such as viewing a mobile screen under direct sunlight or operating on a low-brightness display.
* **Cognitive Load:** High-contrast text improves reading speed, comprehension, and reduces visual fatigue for all users.

### Key Contrast Standards (WCAG Guidelines)

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) set specific luminance contrast ratio thresholds:

| Element Type                                      | WCAG Level AA (Standard) | WCAG Level AAA (Enhanced) |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Normal Text** (< 18pt / 24px)                   | **4.5:1** minimum        | **7:1** minimum           |
| **Large Text** (≥ 18pt / 24px or 14pt bold)       | **3:1** minimum          | **4.5:1** minimum         |
| **UI Components & Icons** (Borders, active icons) | **3:1** minimum          | **4.5:1** minimum         |

---

### Designing Color Systems for Accessibility

#### 1. Never Rely on Color Alone

Color should supplement information, never serve as the sole indicator of state or meaning. Always pair color with text labels, icons, or visual patterns.

* **Bad Practice:** Indicating required form fields or form errors using only red text.
* **Good Practice:** Pairing red text with an icon (e.g., `!`) and explicit helper text (`"Error: Email address is required"`).

#### 2. Design System Tokens & Semantic Color Scales

Define accessibility-compliant color tokens directly in your design system (e.g., CSS variables or Tailwind tokens) so engineers use compliant pairings by default:

```css
:root {
  /* Brand Primitive Colors */
  --color-slate-900: #0f172a;
  --color-slate-100: #f8fafc;
  --color-blue-600: #2563eb;

  /* Semantic Design Tokens (Pre-tested for 4.5:1+ contrast) */
  --bg-primary: var(--color-slate-100);
  --text-primary: var(--color-slate-900); /* 15.6:1 ratio against bg-primary */
  --button-bg: var(--color-blue-600);
  --button-text: #ffffff;                 /* 4.6:1 ratio against button-bg */
}

```

#### 3. Dark Mode & Dynamic Themes

When supporting light and dark modes, contrast must be tested across **both theme palettes**:

* Ensure borders surrounding interactive controls maintain a 3:1 contrast ratio against dark backgrounds.
* Avoid using pure black (`#000000`) on pure white (`#ffffff`) or vice versa if contrast creates harsh visual vibrating edges; off-black and off-white shades often offer softer, readable experiences while easily satisfying the 4.5:1 rule.

## 3. Implementing Focus & Contrast in Front-End Workflows

| Phase                    | Focus Management Strategy                                                                                             | Color Contrast Strategy                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design / Token Stage** | Map out focus order in wireframes; define explicit `:focus-visible` styles.                                           | Pre-audit color palettes for AA/AAA compliance using tools like Stark or Figma Contrast plugin. |
| **Development**          | Use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<a href>`, `<input>`); manage focus via React/Vue refs or custom hooks (`useDialog`). | Leverage CSS custom properties with pre-calculated contrast ratios.                             |
| **Automated Testing**    | Unit/E2E test focus positioning using Playwright or Cypress (`expect(element).toBeFocused()`).                        | Integrate `axe-core` or Lighthouse into CI/CD pipelines to flag automated contrast failures.    |
| **Manual Testing**       | Navigate primary flows using only `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, `Space`, `Enter`, and `Esc` keys.                               | Test apps under sunlight simulation or using color blindness emulator extensions.               |
