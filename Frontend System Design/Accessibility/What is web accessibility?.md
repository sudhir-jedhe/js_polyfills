***  What is web accessibility?.md ***

**Web Accessibility** (often abbreviated as **a11y**) is the practice of designing and developing websites and web applications so that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the digital world.

It ensures that digital products do not create artificial barriers for individuals with visual, auditory, motor, speech, or cognitive impairments—as well as people experiencing situational or temporary limitations (such as a broken arm or bright outdoor sunlight).

## The Four Principles: POUR Framework

The international foundation for web accessibility is governed by the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** created by the W3C. WCAG is built on four core principles known as **POUR**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                       THE POUR ACCESSIBILITY FRAMEWORK                      │

│  1. PERCEIVABLE   ──► Information must be presentable in ways users can     │
│                       sense (see, hear, or read via screen reader).         │
│  2. OPERABLE      ──► UI components must be usable across all input methods │
│                       (keyboard, mouse, touch, voice control).              │
│  3. UNDERSTANDABLE ──► UI text, navigation, and feedback must be clear      │
│                       and predictable.                                      │
│  4. ROBUST        ──► Content must be compatible with current and future    │
│                       browsers and assistive technologies.                  │

## Who Benefits from Web Accessibility?

Accessibility impacts a wide range of disability categories:

1. **Visual Impairments:** Blindness, low vision, and color blindness. Benefited by screen readers, high color contrast, and scalable text sizes.
2. **Motor & Mobility Impairments:** Tremors, paralysis, or loss of limbs. Benefited by full keyboard navigation, large touch targets, and voice control software.
3. **Auditory Impairments:** Deafness or hard of hearing. Benefited by synchronized video captions, transcripts, and visual alerts.
4. **Cognitive & Learning Disabilities:** Dyslexia, ADHD, or memory limitations. Benefited by clear typography, simple layouts, predictable navigation, and logical error feedback.
5. **Temporary & Situational Limitations:** A user navigating a site with a broken dominant wrist, holding a crying baby, or viewing a screen in harsh glare on a mobile phone.

## Core Technical Building Blocks of Accessible Web Design

Implementing web accessibility in modern front-end architecture relies on several foundational practices:

### A. Semantic HTML First

Using native HTML elements provides built-in accessibility behavior out-of-the-box:

* Use `<button>` instead of `<div onClick={...}>` (buttons are natively keyboard-accessible and announced correctly by screen readers).
* Use structural landmarks like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` so screen reader users can jump directly to key sections.

### B. Keyboard Navigation & Visible Focus

* Ensure every interactive element (links, buttons, form fields, modals) can be navigated using the `Tab`, `Shift + Tab`, `Enter`, and `Space` keys.
* Never remove focus rings using CSS (`outline: none`) without providing a visible focus indicator (`:focus-visible`).

### C. Color Contrast & Visual Indicators

* Text must meet minimum color contrast ratios against its background under WCAG standards ($\ge 4.5:1$ for normal text, $\ge 3:1$ for large text).
* Never use color as the *only* indicator for state or information (e.g., an error input field should display a red border *and* an error icon or text message).

### D. Form Labels & Accessible Names

* Form controls must be explicitly associated with readable labels using `<label htmlFor="email-input">` or `aria-label`.
* Non-text elements like images must include descriptive text (`<img alt="Company logo" />`).

### E. Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)

When custom, complex UI components are built (like custom accordions, tabs, or modals), native HTML may be insufficient. **ARIA attributes** communicate dynamic states and roles to screen readers:

```tsx
// Modal dialog with appropriate ARIA roles and states
<div 
  role="dialog" 
  aria-modal="true" 
  aria-labelledby="modal-title"
>
  <h2 id="modal-title">Terms of Service</h2>
  <button aria-label="Close modal">✕</button>
</div>

```

## Why Web Accessibility Matters

* **Human Rights & Inclusivity:** The web is a fundamental utility for education, employment, healthcare, commerce, and public services. Accessibility ensures equal opportunity for everyone.
* **Legal & Regulatory Compliance:** Many jurisdictions enforce accessibility legally under laws such as the **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** in the US, the **European Accessibility Act (EAA)** in the EU, and **Section 508**.
* **Better Overall UX:** Accessible design benefits *all* users—improving usability on mobile screens, enhancing SEO indexing, and simplifying user interface flows.
