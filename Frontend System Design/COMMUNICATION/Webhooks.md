Here is the English translation of the explanation on Webhooks, their mechanism, their role in front-end system architectures, and best practices:

# Webhooks in Front-End System Design: Instant Notifications, Event-Driven Architecture, and Responsiveness

**Webhooks** function as **"Reverse APIs"** or **"Event-Driven Callbacks"** within system design architectures.

In traditional polling workflows, the client (front-end) repeatedly asks the server, "Is there any new data?" In contrast, with a webhook, **the server proactively notifies the client (or an intermediary backend service) the exact moment a specific event occurs.**

## 1. What is a Webhook and How Does It Work?

A webhook is essentially an **HTTP POST request** automatically dispatched from one system to another whenever a predefined trigger event takes place.

### The Execution Flow

1. **Subscription / Registration:** Your system registers a designated URL (**Webhook Endpoint**) with a third-party service provider (e.g., Stripe, GitHub, WhatsApp API, or backend services).
2. **Event Trigger:** When an event occurs on that external service (e.g., a customer successfully completes a payment or a new repository push is committed), the service fires an HTTP POST request to your registered URL.
3. **Payload Delivery:** The request includes a structured JSON or XML payload containing all relevant details about the event.
4. **Instant Action:** Your system processes the payload instantly, triggering downstream actions and updating the user interface.

## 2. The Role of Webhooks in Front-End System Design

Technically speaking, a **web browser (client) cannot directly act as a public webhook endpoint** because browsers do not possess stable public IP addresses or publicly accessible domains that external servers (like Stripe) can target with HTTP POST requests.

Therefore, in front-end system design, webhooks fit into a hybrid architecture:

1. **Backend as a Bridge:** Third-party providers send webhook payloads directly to your **backend server**.
2. **Real-Time Push to Front-End:** Your backend service ingests the webhook and immediately pushes the event down to the browser client using **WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or Push Notifications**.
3. **Enhanced Responsiveness:** This eliminates the need for the front-end to poll servers continuously. The moment a heavy background event (like payment completion or batch processing) finishes, the backend notifies the front-end, making the UI feel instantly responsive.

```

## 4. Architectural Best Practices for Webhooks

1. **Idempotency:** Network glitches or timeouts can cause third-party services to retry and send duplicate webhook payloads. Your backend systems must handle requests idempotently to prevent duplicate database writes or double-charging.
2. **Security & Signature Validation:** Always validate incoming webhooks using cryptographic signatures (e.g., headers like `X-Hub-Signature`) to verify that the request genuinely originated from the trusted service provider rather than a malicious actor.
3. **Fast Acknowledgement (200 OK):** Webhook endpoints should acknowledge receipt instantly by returning a `200 OK` status code. Heavy background processing or data mutations should be offloaded to asynchronous worker queues (e.g., Redis Queues or AWS SQS) to prevent timeouts.
