The problem you're trying to solve involves finding the number of unique arithmetic triplets in a strictly increasing list of integers, with a given common difference (`diff`). A triplet `(i, j, k)` is an arithmetic triplet if:

1. `i < j < k`
2. `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff`
3. `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`

You already have a solution that uses a `Set` to check if the required numbers for each triplet exist in the list. Let's go through the logic and understand it step-by-step:

### **Solution Walkthrough:**

1. **Using a Set for Fast Lookup:**
   - The `Set` data structure is used to store the elements of `nums`. This allows O(1) average-time complexity for checking if an element exists in the list, which makes the solution efficient.

2. **Iterating through the Array:**
   - You iterate through each element `nums[i]` and for each element, check if both `nums[i] + diff` and `nums[i] + 2 * diff` are present in the set.
   - This ensures that we can form an arithmetic triplet `(nums[i], nums[i] + diff, nums[i] + 2 * diff)`.

3. **Counting Valid Triplets:**
   - Each time you find such a triplet, you increment the count.
   - The count is returned at the end.

### **Time Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because you are iterating through the array once and performing constant-time checks for each element.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the space used by the `Set` to store the elements of `nums`.

### **Example Runthrough:**

#### Example 1:
```javascript
arithmeticTriplets([0,1,4,6,7,10], 3);
```

- `nums = [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10]`, `diff = 3`
  
1. Start with the element `0`. 
   - Check if `0 + 3 = 3` and `0 + 2 * 3 = 6`. Both `3` and `6` are in the list, so it's a valid triplet: `(0, 3, 6)`.

2. Next, check element `1`.
   - Check if `1 + 3 = 4` and `1 + 2 * 3 = 7`. Both `4` and `7` are in the list, so it's a valid triplet: `(1, 4, 7)`.

3. Repeat for the other elements, but no other valid triplets are found.

So the function returns `2`, which is the correct output.

#### Example 2:
```javascript
arithmeticTriplets([4,5,6,7,8,9], 2);
```

- `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `diff = 2`

1. Start with `4`:
   - Check if `4 + 2 = 6` and `4 + 2 * 2 = 8`. Both `6` and `8` are in the list, so it's a valid triplet: `(4, 6, 8)`.

2. Next, check `5`:
   - Check if `5 + 2 = 7` and `5 + 2 * 2 = 9`. Both `7` and `9` are in the list, so it's a valid triplet: `(5, 7, 9)`.

3. No other valid triplets are found.

So the function returns `2`.

### **Final Code:**

Here is the full implementation of the `arithmeticTriplets` function:

```typescript
export function arithmeticTriplets(nums: number[], diff: number): number {
  const numSet = new Set(nums);
  let count = 0;

  // Iterate over the nums array
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
    const currentNum = nums[i];
    // Check if the next two values exist in the set
    if (numSet.has(currentNum + diff) && numSet.has(currentNum + 2 * diff)) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
}
```

### **Testing the Function:**

Here's how you can test the function with some examples:

```javascript
import { arithmeticTriplets } from "./arithmeticTriplets";

const nums1 = [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10];
const diff1 = 3;
console.log(arithmeticTriplets(nums1, diff1)); // Output: 2

const nums2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const diff2 = 2;
console.log(arithmeticTriplets(nums2, diff2)); // Output: 2
```

### **Edge Cases:**

1. **No Valid Triplets:**
   - If there are no valid triplets in the array, the function will return `0`.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   arithmeticTriplets([1, 2, 4, 5], 3);  // Output: 0
   ```

2. **Very Large Array:**
   - The solution should work efficiently even for large arrays due to its O(n) time complexity.

3. **Arrays with Less than 3 Elements:**
   - If the array has fewer than 3 elements, itâ€™s impossible to form a triplet, so the function will return `0`.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   arithmeticTriplets([1, 2], 1);  // Output: 0
   ```

This approach is both efficient and easy to understand. The use of a `Set` for fast lookups ensures that the solution can handle large input sizes within the problem's constraints.
