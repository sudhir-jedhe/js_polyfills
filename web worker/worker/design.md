To count the frequency of letters in a text using parallel computation in JavaScript, you can split the text into chunks and process each chunk concurrently using web workers. Here's how you can implement this approach:

Split the text into chunks.
Create a web worker script to count the frequency of letters in each chunk.
Spawn multiple web workers to process each chunk in parallel.
Aggregate the results from all workers to get the final frequency count.
