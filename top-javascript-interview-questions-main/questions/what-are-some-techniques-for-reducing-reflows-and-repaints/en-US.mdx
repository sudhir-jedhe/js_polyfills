title: What are some techniques for reducing reflows and repaints?
---

## TL;DR

To reduce reflows and repaints, you can minimize DOM manipulations, batch DOM changes, use CSS classes for style changes, avoid complex CSS selectors, and use `requestAnimationFrame` for animations. Additionally, consider using `will-change` for elements that will change frequently and avoid layout thrashing by reading and writing to the DOM separately.

## Techniques for reducing reflows and repaints

### Minimize DOM manipulations

Frequent changes to the DOM can cause multiple reflows and repaints. To minimize this:

- Use `documentFragment` to batch DOM updates
- Clone nodes, make changes, and then replace the original node

### Batch DOM changes

Grouping multiple DOM changes together can reduce the number of reflows and repaints:

- Use `innerHTML` to update multiple elements at once
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` to batch updates

### Use CSS classes for style changes

Instead of changing styles directly via JavaScript, use CSS classes:

```js
element.classList.add('new-class');
```

### Avoid complex CSS selectors

Complex selectors can slow down the rendering process:

- Use simple and direct selectors
- Avoid deep nesting

### Use `requestAnimationFrame` for animations

Using `requestAnimationFrame` ensures that animations are synchronized with the browser's repaint cycle:

```js
function animate() {
  // Animation logic
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}
requestAnimationFrame(animate);
```

### Use `will-change` for frequently changing elements

The `will-change` property can hint to the browser about which elements will change, allowing it to optimize rendering:

```css
.element {
  will-change: transform;
}
```

### Avoid layout thrashing

Reading and writing to the DOM separately can prevent layout thrashing:

```js
const height = element.offsetHeight; // Read
element.style.height = `${height + 10}px`; // Write
```
