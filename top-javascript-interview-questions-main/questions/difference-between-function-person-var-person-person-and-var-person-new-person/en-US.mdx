title: 'Difference between: `function Person(){}`, `const person = Person()`, and `const person = new Person()` in JavaScript?'
---

## TL;DR

- `function Person(){}`: A function declaration in JavaScript. It can be used as a regular function or as a constructor.
- `const person = Person()`: Calls `Person` as a regular function, not a constructor. If `Person` is intended to be a constructor, this will lead to unexpected behavior.
- `const person = new Person()`: Creates a new instance of `Person`, correctly utilizing the constructor function to initialize the new object.

| Aspect | `function Person(){}` | `const person = Person()` | `const person = new Person()` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Function declaration | Function call | Constructor call |
| Usage | Defines a function | Invokes `Person` as a regular function | Creates a new instance of `Person` |
| Instance Creation | No instance created | No instance created | New instance created |
| Common Mistake | N/A | Misusing as constructor leading to `undefined` | None (when used correctly) |

## Function declaration

`function Person(){}` is a standard function declaration in JavaScript. When written in PascalCase, it follows the convention for functions intended to be used as constructors.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```

This code defines a function named `Person` that takes a parameter `name` and assigns it to the `name` property of the object created from this constructor function. When the `this` keyword is used in a constructor, it refers to the newly created object.

## Function call

`const person = Person()` simply invoke the function's code. When you invoke `Person` as a regular function (i.e., without the `new` keyword), the function does not behave as a constructor. Instead, it executes its code and returns `undefined` if no return value is specified and that gets assigned to the variable intended as the instance. Invoking as such is a common mistake if the function is intended to be used as a constructor.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const person = Person('John');
console.log(person); // undefined
console.log(person.name); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

In this case, `Person('John')` does not create a new object. The `person` variable is assigned `undefined` because the `Person` function does not explicitly return a value. Attempting to access `person.name` throws an error because `person` is `undefined`.

## Constructor call

`const person = new Person()` creates an instance of the `Person` object using the new operator, which inherits from `Person.prototype`. An alternative would be to use `Object.create`, such as: `Object.create(Person.prototype)` and `Person.call(person, 'John')` initializes the object.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const person = new Person('John');
console.log(person); // Person { name: 'John' }
console.log(person.name); // 'John'

// Alternative
const person1 = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Person.call(person1, 'John');
console.log(person1); // Person { name: 'John' }
console.log(person1.name); // 'John'
```

In this case, `new Person('John')` creates a new object, and `this` within `Person` refers to this new object. The `name` property is correctly set on the new object. The `person` variable is assigned the new instance of `Person` with the name property set to `'John'`. And for the alternative object creation, `Object.create(Person.prototype)` creates a new object with `Person.prototype` as its prototype. `Person.call(person, 'John')` initializes the object, setting the `name` property.
