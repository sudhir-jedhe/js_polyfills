title: What is the purpose of the `break` and `continue` statements?
---

## TL;DR

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely, while the `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. For example, in a `for` loop, `break` will stop the loop entirely, and `continue` will skip to the next iteration.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) break; // exits the loop when i is 5
  console.log(i);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) continue; // skips the iteration when i is 5
  console.log(i);
}
```

## Purpose of the `break` and `continue` statements

### `break` statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a switch statement before it has completed all its iterations or cases. This is useful when you want to stop the execution of the loop or switch based on a certain condition.

#### Example in a loop

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) break; // exits the loop when i is 5
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 2 3 4
```

#### Example in a switch statement

```js
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log('Monday');
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log('Tuesday');
    break;
  // other cases
  default:
    console.log('Invalid day');
}
```

### `continue` statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. This is useful when you want to skip certain iterations based on a condition without exiting the loop entirely.

#### Example in a loop

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) continue; // skips the iteration when i is 5
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
```

### Differences between `break` and `continue`

- The `break` statement exits the loop or switch statement entirely.
- The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
