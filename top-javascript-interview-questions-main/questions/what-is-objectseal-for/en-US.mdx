title: What is `Object.seal()` for?
---

## TL;DR

`Object.seal()` is used to prevent new properties from being added to an object and to mark all existing properties as non-configurable. This means you can still modify the values of existing properties, but you cannot delete them or add new ones.

```js
const obj = { name: 'John' };
Object.seal(obj);

obj.name = 'Jane'; // Allowed
obj.age = 30; // Not allowed
delete obj.name; // Not allowed
```

## What is `Object.seal()` for?

`Object.seal()` is a method in JavaScript that seals an object, preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. This means that while you can still modify the values of existing properties, you cannot delete them or add new properties.

### Syntax

```js
Object.seal(obj);
```

- `obj`: The object to be sealed.

### Behavior

1. **Preventing new properties**: Once an object is sealed, you cannot add new properties to it.
2. **Non-configurable properties**: All existing properties become non-configurable, meaning you cannot delete them or change their property descriptors (e.g., making them non-writable).
3. **Modifiable values**: You can still change the values of existing properties as long as they are writable.

### Example

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,
};

Object.seal(person);

person.name = 'Bob'; // Allowed
person.age = 30; // Allowed

person.gender = 'female'; // Not allowed, throws an error in strict mode
delete person.name; // Not allowed, throws an error in strict mode

console.log(person); // { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }
```

### Use cases

- **Data integrity**: Ensuring that an object structure remains unchanged, which can be useful in scenarios where the object represents a fixed schema.
- **Security**: Preventing accidental or malicious modifications to an object, especially in shared or global contexts.

### Checking if an object is sealed

You can check if an object is sealed using the `Object.isSealed()` method.

```js
const obj = { name: 'John' };
Object.seal(obj);

console.log(Object.isSealed(obj)); // true
```
