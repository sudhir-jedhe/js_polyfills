title: What are JavaScript object getters and setters for?
---

## TL;DR

JavaScript object getters and setters are used to control access to an object's properties. They provide a way to encapsulate the implementation details of a property and define custom behavior when getting or setting its value.

Getters and setters are defined using the `get` and `set` keywords, respectively, followed by a function that is executed when the property is accessed or assigned a new value.

Here's a code example demonstrating the use of getters and setters:

```js
const person = {
  _name: 'John Doe', // Private property

  get name() {
    // Getter
    return this._name;
  },
  set name(newName) {
    // Setter
    if (newName.trim().length > 0) {
      this._name = newName;
    } else {
      console.log('Invalid name');
    }
  },
};

// Accessing the name property using the getter
console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John Doe'

// Setting the name property using the setter
person.name = 'Jane Smith'; // Setter is called
console.log(person.name); // Output: 'Jane Smith'

person.name = ''; // Setter is called, but the value is not set due to validation
console.log(person.name); // Output: 'Jane Smith'
```

## JavaScript object getters and setters

In JavaScript, getters and setters are special methods that allow you to control how properties of an object are accessed and modified.

- **Getters**: Functions that are invoked whenever you try to access a property using dot notation (e.g., `obj.name`). They provide a way to customize the value that is returned when the property is read.
- **Setters**: Functions that are called when you try to assign a value to a property using dot notation with the assignment operator (e.g., `obj.name = "John"`). They allow you to perform actions like data validation, formatting, or side effects before the actual value is stored in the object.

```js
const person = {
  _firstName: 'John',
  _lastName: 'Doe',
  get fullName() {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
  },
  set fullName(value) {
    const parts = value.split(' ');
    this._firstName = parts[0];
    this._lastName = parts[1];
  },
};

console.log(person.fullName); // Output: John Doe
person.fullName = 'Jane Smith';
console.log(person.fullName); // Output: Jane Smith
```

In this example, the `fullName` property doesn't have a direct value stored in the object. The getter function calculates it by combining the `_firstName` and `_lastName` properties. The setter splits the assigned value into first and last names and updates the internal properties accordingly.

## Benefits

Getters and setters provide several benefits:

1. **Encapsulation**: They allow you to encapsulate the implementation details of a property, making it easier to change the internal representation without affecting external code that uses the property.
1. **Data validation**: Setters can be used to validate the values being assigned to a property, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
1. **Computed Properties**: Getters can be used to compute and return a derived value based on other properties or calculations.
1. **Side effects**: Setters can be used to perform side effects when a property is changed. For example, you might update a related property or trigger an action when a specific value is assigned/modified, such as logging or debugging.
