title: Explain what a single page app is and how to make one SEO-friendly
---

## TL;DR

A single page application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user interacts with the app. This approach provides a more fluid user experience but can be challenging for SEO because search engines may not execute JavaScript to render content. To make an SPA SEO-friendly, you can use server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) to ensure that search engines can index your content. Tools like Next.js for React or Nuxt.js for Vue.js can help achieve this.

## What is a single page app?

### Definition

A single page application (SPA) is a web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. This results in a more fluid user experience, similar to a desktop application.

### Key characteristics

- The application loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates it as the user interacts with the app
- Uses AJAX or Fetch API to communicate with the server and update the page without a full reload
- Often relies on client-side routing to manage different views or states within the app

### Benefits

- Faster interactions after the initial load
- Reduced server load due to fewer full-page requests
- Improved user experience with smoother transitions

## How to make an SPA SEO-friendly

### Challenges

SPAs can be challenging for SEO because search engines may not execute JavaScript to render content. This can result in search engines indexing an empty or incomplete page.

### Solutions

#### Server-side rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering involves rendering the initial HTML of the page on the server before sending it to the client. This ensures that search engines can index the fully rendered content.

- **React**: Use Next.js, which provides built-in support for SSR
- **Vue.js**: Use Nuxt.js, which also supports SSR out of the box

Example with Next.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { GetServerSideProps } from 'next';

const Page = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
};

export default Page;
```

#### Static site generation (SSG)

Static site generation involves generating the HTML for each page at build time. This approach is suitable for content that doesn't change frequently.

- **React**: Use Next.js with its static generation capabilities
- **Vue.js**: Use Nuxt.js with its static site generation feature

Example with Next.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next';

const Page = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
};

export default Page;
```

#### Pre-rendering with tools

Some tools can pre-render your SPA and serve the pre-rendered HTML to search engines.

- **Prerender.io**: A service that pre-renders your JavaScript application and serves the static HTML to search engines
- **Rendertron**: A headless Chrome rendering solution that can be used to pre-render your SPA
