title: What is the purpose of the `switch` statement?
---

## TL;DR

The `switch` statement is used to execute one block of code among many based on the value of an expression. It is an alternative to using multiple `if...else if` statements. The `switch` statement evaluates an expression, matches the expression's value to a `case` label, and executes the associated block of code. If no `case` matches, the `default` block is executed.

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression === value2
    break;
  default:
  // code to be executed if no case matches
}
```

## Purpose of the `switch` statement

### Simplifies multiple conditional checks

The `switch` statement provides a cleaner and more readable way to handle multiple conditional checks compared to using multiple `if...else if` statements. It is particularly useful when you need to compare the same expression against different values.

### Syntax and structure

The basic syntax of a `switch` statement is as follows:

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression === value2
    break;
  // more cases...
  default:
  // code to be executed if no case matches
}
```

### How it works

1. **Expression evaluation**: The `switch` statement evaluates the expression once.
2. **Case matching**: It compares the result of the expression to the values of each `case` label.
3. **Code execution**: If a match is found, the code associated with that `case` is executed.
4. **Break statement**: The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` block. If omitted, the next `case` will be executed (fall-through behavior).
5. **Default case**: The `default` case is optional and executes if no matching `case` is found.

### Example

Here is an example of a `switch` statement in action:

```js
let fruit = 'apple';

switch (fruit) {
  case 'banana':
    console.log('Banana is yellow.');
    break;
  case 'apple':
    console.log('Apple is red.');
    break;
  case 'grape':
    console.log('Grape is purple.');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Unknown fruit.');
}
```

In this example, the output will be `Apple is red.` because the value of `fruit` matches the `case 'apple'`.

### Fall-through behavior

If the `break` statement is omitted, the `switch` statement will continue to execute the subsequent `case` blocks until it encounters a `break` or the end of the `switch` block. This is known as fall-through behavior.

```js
let day = 2;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log('Monday');
  case 2:
    console.log('Tuesday');
  case 3:
    console.log('Wednesday');
  default:
    console.log('Unknown day');
}
```

In this example, the output will be:

```
Tuesday
Wednesday
Unknown day
```

This happens because there are no `break` statements to stop the execution after the `case 2` block.
