title: Explain the different ways the `this` keyword can be bound
---

## TL;DR

The `this` keyword in JavaScript can be bound in several ways:

- Default binding: In non-strict mode, `this` refers to the global object (window in browsers). In strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.
- Implicit binding: When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to the object.
- Explicit binding: Using `call`, `apply`, or `bind` methods to explicitly set `this`.
- New binding: When a function is used as a constructor with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the newly created object.
- Arrow functions: Arrow functions do not have their own `this` and inherit `this` from the surrounding lexical context.

## Default binding

In non-strict mode, if a function is called without any context, `this` refers to the global object (window in browsers). In strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.

```js
function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

showThis(); // In non-strict mode: window, in strict mode: undefined
```

## Implicit binding

When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to the object.

```js
const obj = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function () {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

obj.greet(); // 'Alice'
```

## Explicit binding

Using `call`, `apply`, or `bind` methods, you can explicitly set `this`.

### Using `call`

```js
function greet() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'Bob' };

greet.call(person); // 'Bob'
```

### Using `apply`

```js
function greet(greeting) {
  console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'Charlie' };

greet.apply(person, ['Hello']); // 'Hello, Charlie'
```

### Using `bind`

```js
function greet() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

const person = { name: 'Dave' };

const boundGreet = greet.bind(person);
boundGreet(); // 'Dave'
```

## New binding

When a function is used as a constructor with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the newly created object.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const person = new Person('Eve');
console.log(person.name); // 'Eve'
```

## Arrow functions

Arrow functions do not have their own `this` and inherit `this` from the surrounding lexical context.

```js
const obj = {
  name: 'Frank',
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

obj.greet(); // undefined, because `this` is inherited from the global scope
```
