title: How do currying and partial application differ from each other?
---

## TL;DR

Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. For example, a function `f(a, b, c)` becomes `f(a)(b)(c)`. Partial application, on the other hand, fixes a few arguments of a function and produces another function with a smaller number of arguments. For example, if you partially apply `f(a, b, c)` with `a`, you get a new function `f'(b, c)`.

## Currying vs partial application

### Currying

Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for more flexible function composition and reuse.

#### Example

```js
function add(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

const result = add(1)(2)(3); // 6
```

In this example, `add` is a curried function that takes three arguments one at a time.

### Partial application

Partial application is a technique where you fix a few arguments of a function, producing another function with a smaller number of arguments. This is useful for creating specialized functions from more general ones.

#### Example

```js
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

const addOne = add.bind(null, 1);
const result = addOne(2, 3); // 6
```

In this example, `addOne` is a partially applied function that fixes the first argument of `add` to `1`.

### Key differences

- **Currying**: Transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.
- **Partial application**: Fixes a few arguments of a function and produces another function with a smaller number of arguments.
