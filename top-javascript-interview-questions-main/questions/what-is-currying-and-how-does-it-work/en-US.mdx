---

## TL;DR

Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions that each take a single argument. This allows for partial application of functions. For example, a function `f(a, b, c)` can be curried into `f(a)(b)(c)`. Here's a simple example in JavaScript:

```js
function add(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

const addOne = add(1);
const addOneAndTwo = addOne(2);
const result = addOneAndTwo(3); // result is 6
```

## What is currying and how does it work?

### Definition

Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is decomposed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for the partial application of functions, enabling more flexible and reusable code.

### How it works

1. **Transformation**: A function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a series of nested functions, each taking one argument.
2. **Partial application**: You can call the curried function with fewer arguments than it expects, and it will return a new function that takes the remaining arguments.

### Example in JavaScript

Here's a simple example to illustrate currying in JavaScript:

```js
// Non-curried function
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

// Curried version of the same function
function curriedAdd(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

// Using the curried function
const addOne = curriedAdd(1);
const addOneAndTwo = addOne(2);
const result = addOneAndTwo(3); // result is 6
```

### Benefits of currying

1. **Reusability**: Curried functions can be reused with different sets of arguments.
2. **Partial application**: You can create new functions by fixing some arguments of the original function.
3. **Function composition**: Currying makes it easier to compose functions, leading to more readable and maintainable code.

### Practical example

Consider a function that calculates the volume of a rectangular prism:

```js
function volume(length, width, height) {
  return length * width * height;
}

// Curried version
function curriedVolume(length) {
  return function (width) {
    return function (height) {
      return length * width * height;
    };
  };
}

// Using the curried function
const volumeWithLength5 = curriedVolume(5);
const volumeWithLength5AndWidth4 = volumeWithLength5(4);
const result = volumeWithLength5AndWidth4(3); // result is 60
```

### Currying with arrow functions

You can also use arrow functions to make the syntax more concise:

```js
const curriedAdd = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;

const addOne = curriedAdd(1);
const addOneAndTwo = addOne(2);
const result = addOneAndTwo(3); // result is 6
```
