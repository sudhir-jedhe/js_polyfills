title: Explain the different states of a Promise
---

## TL;DR

A `Promise` in JavaScript can be in one of three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, or `rejected`. When a `Promise` is created, it starts in the `pending` state. If the operation completes successfully, the `Promise` transitions to the `fulfilled` state, and if it fails, it transitions to the `rejected` state. Here's a quick example:

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // some asynchronous operation
  if (success) {
    resolve('Success!');
  } else {
    reject('Error!');
  }
});
```

## Different states of a Promise

### Pending

When a `Promise` is first created, it is in the `pending` state. This means that the asynchronous operation has not yet completed.

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // asynchronous operation
});
```

### Fulfilled

A `Promise` transitions to the `fulfilled` state when the asynchronous operation completes successfully. The `resolve` function is called to indicate this.

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Success!');
});
```

### Rejected

A `Promise` transitions to the `rejected` state when the asynchronous operation fails. The `reject` function is called to indicate this.

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  reject('Error!');
});
```
