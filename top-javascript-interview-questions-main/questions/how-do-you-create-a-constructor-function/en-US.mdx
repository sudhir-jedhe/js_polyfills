title: How do you create a constructor function?
---

## TL;DR

To create a constructor function in JavaScript, define a regular function with a capitalized name to indicate it's a constructor. Use the `this` keyword to set properties and methods. When creating an instance, use the `new` keyword.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const john = new Person('John', 30);
```

## How do you create a constructor function?

### Defining a constructor function

A constructor function in JavaScript is a regular function that is used to create objects. By convention, the name of the constructor function starts with a capital letter to distinguish it from regular functions.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
```

### Using the `this` keyword

Within the constructor function, the `this` keyword is used to refer to the object that will be created. Properties and methods can be assigned to `this`.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.greet = function () {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`,
    );
  };
}
```

### Creating an instance

To create an instance of the object, use the `new` keyword followed by the constructor function.

```js
const john = new Person('John', 30);
john.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

### Adding methods to the prototype

To save memory, it's a good practice to add methods to the constructor's prototype instead of defining them inside the constructor function.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};

const jane = new Person('Jane', 25);
jane.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old.
```

### Checking the instance type

You can check if an object is an instance of a constructor function using the `instanceof` operator.

```js
console.log(jane instanceof Person); // Output: true
```
