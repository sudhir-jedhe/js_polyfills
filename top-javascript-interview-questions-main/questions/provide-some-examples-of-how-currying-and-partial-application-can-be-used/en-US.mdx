title: Provide some examples of how currying and partial application can be used
---

## TL;DR

Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. Partial application fixes a few arguments of a function, producing another function with a smaller number of arguments. For example, currying a function `add(a, b)` would look like `add(a)(b)`, while partial application of `add(2, b)` would fix the first argument to 2, resulting in a function that only needs the second argument.

```js
// Currying example
const add = (a) => (b) => a + b;
const addTwo = add(2);
console.log(addTwo(3)); // 5

// Partial application example
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const addTwo = add.bind(null, 2);
console.log(addTwo(3)); // 5
```

## Currying and partial application

### Currying

Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for more flexible function composition and reuse.

#### Example

Consider a simple function that adds two numbers:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

To curry this function, we transform it into a series of functions, each taking one argument:

```js
const add = (a) => (b) => a + b;
```

Now, you can use the curried function like this:

```js
const addTwo = add(2);
console.log(addTwo(3)); // 5
```

### Partial application

Partial application is a technique where you fix a few arguments of a function, producing another function with a smaller number of arguments. This is useful for creating specialized functions from more general ones.

#### Example

Consider the same `add` function:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

To partially apply this function, you can use the `bind` method to fix the first argument:

```js
const addTwo = add.bind(null, 2);
console.log(addTwo(3)); // 5
```

Alternatively, you can create a custom partial application function:

```js
function partial(fn, ...fixedArgs) {
  return function (...remainingArgs) {
    return fn(...fixedArgs, ...remainingArgs);
  };
}

const addTwo = partial(add, 2);
console.log(addTwo(3)); // 5
```
