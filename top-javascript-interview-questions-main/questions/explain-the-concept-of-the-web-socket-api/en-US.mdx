title: Explain the concept of the Web Socket API

## TL;DR

The WebSocket API provides a way to open a persistent connection between a client and a server, allowing for real-time, two-way communication. Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based, WebSocket enables full-duplex communication, meaning both the client and server can send and receive messages independently. This is particularly useful for applications like chat apps, live updates, and online gaming.

```js
// Example of creating a WebSocket connection
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket');

// Event listener for when the connection is open
socket.addEventListener('open', function (event) {
  socket.send('Hello Server!');
});

// Event listener for when a message is received from the server
socket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
  console.log('Message from server ', event.data);
});
```

## What is the WebSocket API?

The WebSocket API is a technology that provides a way to establish a persistent, low-latency, full-duplex communication channel between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. This is different from the traditional HTTP request-response model, which is stateless and requires a new connection for each request.

### Key features

- **Full-duplex communication**: Both the client and server can send and receive messages independently.
- **Low latency**: The persistent connection reduces the overhead of establishing a new connection for each message.
- **Real-time updates**: Ideal for applications that require real-time data, such as chat applications, live sports updates, and online gaming.

### How it works

1. **Connection establishment**: The client initiates a WebSocket connection by sending a handshake request to the server.
2. **Handshake response**: The server responds with a handshake response, and if successful, the connection is established.
3. **Data exchange**: Both the client and server can now send and receive messages independently over the established connection.
4. **Connection closure**: Either the client or server can close the connection when it is no longer needed.

### Example usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the WebSocket API in JavaScript:

```js
// Create a new WebSocket connection
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket');

// Event listener for when the connection is open
socket.addEventListener('open', function (event) {
  console.log('Connection opened');
  socket.send('Hello Server!');
});

// Event listener for when a message is received from the server
socket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
  console.log('Message from server ', event.data);
});

// Event listener for when the connection is closed
socket.addEventListener('close', function (event) {
  console.log('Connection closed');
});

// Event listener for when an error occurs
socket.addEventListener('error', function (event) {
  console.error('WebSocket error: ', event);
});
```

### Use cases

- **Chat applications**: Real-time messaging between users.
- **Live updates**: Stock prices, sports scores, or news updates.
- **Online gaming**: Real-time interaction between players.
- **Collaborative tools**: Real-time document editing or whiteboarding.
