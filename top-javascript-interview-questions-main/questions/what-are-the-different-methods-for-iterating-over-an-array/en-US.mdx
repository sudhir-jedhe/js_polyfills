---

## TL;DR

There are several methods to iterate over an array in JavaScript. The most common ones include `for` loops, `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `for...of`. Each method has its own use case. For example, `for` loops are versatile and can be used for any kind of iteration, while `forEach` is specifically for executing a function on each array element. `map` is used for transforming arrays, `filter` for filtering elements, `reduce` for accumulating values, and `for...of` for iterating over iterable objects.

## Different methods for iterating over an array

### For loop

The `for` loop is one of the most basic and versatile ways to iterate over an array. It allows you to control the iteration process completely.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
```

### For...of loop

The `for...of` loop is a more modern and readable way to iterate over arrays and other iterable objects.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (const element of array) {
  console.log(element);
}
```

### forEach method

The `forEach` method executes a provided function once for each array element.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
array.forEach((element) => {
  console.log(element);
});
```

### Map method

The `map` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = array.map((element) => element * 2);
console.log(newArray); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### Filter method

The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const filteredArray = array.filter((element) => element > 2);
console.log(filteredArray); // [3, 4, 5]
```

### Reduce method

The `reduce` method executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = array.reduce(
  (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
  0,
);
console.log(sum); // 15
```
