title: Explain how `this` works in JavaScript
---

## TL;DR

There's no simple explanation for `this`; it is one of the most confusing concepts in JavaScript because it's behavior differs from many other programming languages. The one-liner explanation of the `this` keyword is that it is a dynamic reference to the context in which a function is executed.

A longer explanation follows is that `this` follows these rules:

1. If the `new` keyword is used when calling the function, meaning the function was used as a function constructor, the `this` inside the function is the newly-created object instance.
2. If `this` is used in a `class` `constructor`, the `this` inside the `constructor` is the newly-created object instance.
3. If `apply()`, `call()`, or `bind()` is used to call/create a function, `this` inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.
4. If a function is called as a method (e.g. `obj.method()`) — `this` is the object that the function is a property of.
5. If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, `this` is the global object. In the browser, the global object is the `window` object. If in strict mode (`'use strict';`), `this` will be `undefined` instead of the global object.
6. If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the `this` value.
7. If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the `this` value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.

## `this` keyword

In JavaScript, `this` is a keyword that refers to the current execution context of a function or script. It's a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and understanding how `this` works is crucial for building robust and maintainable applications.

### Used globally

In the global scope, `this` refers to the global object, which is the `window` object in a web browser or the `global` object in a Node.js environment.

```js
console.log(this); // In a browser, this will log the window object (for non-strict mode).
```

### Within a regular function call

When a function is called in the global context or as a standalone function, `this` refers to the global object (in non-strict mode) or `undefined` (in strict mode).

```js
function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

showThis(); // In non-strict mode: Window (global object). In strict mode: undefined.
```

### Within a method call

When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to the object that the method is called on.

```js
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  showThis: function () {
    console.log(this);
  },
};

obj.showThis(); // { name: 'John', showThis: ƒ }
```

Note that if you do the following, it is as good as a regular function call and not a method call. `this` has lost its context and no longer points to `obj`.

```js
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  showThis: function () {
    console.log(this);
  },
};

const showThisStandalone = obj.showThis;
showThisStandalone(); // In non-strict mode: Window (global object). In strict mode: undefined.
```

### Within a function constructor

When a function is used as a constructor (called with the `new` keyword), `this` refers to the newly-created instance. In the following example, `this` refers to the `Person` object being created, and the `name` property is set on that object.

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const person = new Person('John');
console.log(person.name); // "John"
```

### Within class constructor and methods

In ES2015 classes, `this` behaves as it does in object methods. It refers to the instance of the class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  showThis() {
    console.log(this);
  }
}

const person = new Person('John');
person.showThis(); // Person {name: 'John'}

const showThisStandalone = person.showThis;
showThisStandalone(); // `undefined` because all parts of a class' body are strict mode.
```

### Explicitly binding `this`

You can use `bind()`, `call()`, or `apply()` to explicitly set the value of `this` for a function.

Using the `call()` and `apply()` methods allow you to explicitly set the value of `this` when calling the function.

```js
function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}
const obj = { name: 'John' };

showThis.call(obj); // { name: 'John' }
showThis.apply(obj); // { name: 'John' }
```

The `bind()` method creates a new function with `this` bound to the specified value.

```js
function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}
const obj = { name: 'John' };

const boundFunc = showThis.bind(obj);
boundFunc(); // { name: 'John' }
```

### Within arrow functions

Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. Instead, the `this` is lexically scoped, which means it inherits the `this` value from its surrounding scope at the time they are defined.

In this example, `this` refers to the global object (window or global), because the arrow function is not bound to the `person` object.

```js
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  sayHello: () => {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
  },
};

person.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is undefined!"
```

In the following example, the `this` in the arrow function will be the `this` value of its enclosing context, so it depends on how `showThis()` is called.

```js
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  showThis: function () {
    const arrowFunc = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
    arrowFunc();
  },
};

obj.showThis(); // { name: 'John', showThis: ƒ }

const showThisStandalone = obj.showThis;
showThisStandalone(); // In non-strict mode: Window (global object). In strict mode: undefined.
```

Therefore, the `this` value in arrow functions cannot be set by `bind()`, `apply()` or `call()` methods, nor does it point to the current object in object methods.

```js
const obj = {
  name: 'Alice',
  regularFunction: function () {
    console.log('Regular function:', this.name);
  },
  arrowFunction: () => {
    console.log('Arrow function:', this.name);
  },
};

const anotherObj = {
  name: 'Bob',
};

// Using call/apply/bind with a regular function
obj.regularFunction.call(anotherObj); // Regular function: Bob
obj.regularFunction.apply(anotherObj); // Regular function: Bob
const boundRegularFunction = obj.regularFunction.bind(anotherObj);
boundRegularFunction(); // Regular function: Bob

// Using call/apply/bind with an arrow function, `this` refers to the global scope and cannot be modified.
obj.arrowFunction.call(anotherObj); // Arrow function: window/undefined (depending if strict mode)
obj.arrowFunction.apply(anotherObj); // Arrow function: window/undefined (depending if strict mode)
const boundArrowFunction = obj.arrowFunction.bind(anotherObj);
boundArrowFunction(); // Arrow function: window/undefined (depending if strict mode)
```

### Within event handlers

When a function is called as a DOM event handler, `this` refers to the element that triggered the event. In this example, `this` refers to the `<button>` element that was clicked.

```html
<button id="my-button" onclick="console.log(this)">Click me</button>
<!-- Logs the button element -->
```

When setting an event handler using JavaScript, this also refers to the element that received the event.

```js
document.getElementById('my-button').addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log(this); // Logs the button element
});
```

As mentioned above, ES2015 introduces [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) which uses the [enclosing lexical scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#No_separate_this). This is usually convenient, but does prevent the caller from defining the `this` context via `.call`/`.apply`/`.bind`. One of the consequences is that DOM event handlers will not properly bind `this` in your event handler functions if you define the callback parameters to `.addEventListener()` using arrow functions.

```js
document.getElementById('my-button').addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log(this); // Window / undefined (depending on whether strict mode) instead of the button element.
});
```

In summary, `this` in JavaScript refers to the current execution context of a function or script, and its value can change depending on the context in which it is used. Understanding how `this` works is essential for building robust and maintainable JavaScript applications.
