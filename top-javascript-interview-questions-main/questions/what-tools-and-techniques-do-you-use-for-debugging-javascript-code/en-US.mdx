title: What tools and techniques do you use for debugging JavaScript code?
---

## TL;DR

Some of the most commonly used tools and techniques for debugging JavaScript:

- JavaScript language
  - `console` methods (e.g. `console.log()`, `console.error()`, `console.warn()`, `console.table()`)
  - `debugger` statement
- Breakpoints (browser or IDE)
- JavaScript frameworks
  - [React Devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)
  - [Redux Devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
  - [Vue Devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools)
- Browser developer tools
  - **Chrome DevTools**: The most widely used tool for debugging JavaScript. It provides a rich set of features including the ability to set breakpoints, inspect variables, view the call stack, and more.
  - **Firefox Developer Tools**: Similar to Chrome DevTools with its own set of features for debugging.
  - **Safari Web Inspector**: Provides tools for debugging on Safari.
  - **Edge Developer Tools**: Similar to Chrome DevTools, as Edge is now Chromium-based.
- Network requests
  - **Postman**: Useful for debugging API calls.
  - **Fiddler**: Helps capture and inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
  - **Charles Proxy**: Another tool for intercepting and debugging network calls.

## Debugging JavaScript

Here are common tools and techniques developers frequently use for debugging JavaScript code.

### `console` methods

- `console.log()`: The most basic way to inspect values, variables, and data structures at various points in your code.
- `console.error()`: Outputs errors to the console, often with more detailed stack traces.
- `console.warn()`: Displays warnings.
- `console.table()`: Formats data (especially arrays of objects) in a readable table.
- `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()`: Measure the execution time of code blocks.

### `debugger` statement

- Pauses code execution at the line where `debugger;` is placed.
- Allows you to step through code line by line, inspect variables, and understand the flow of execution.

### Breakpoints

- Set breakpoints directly in the Sources panel of your browser's developer tools or IDE (e.g. VS Code) to pause execution at specific lines of code without modifying your source code.

### Network tab

- Monitor network requests made by your JavaScript code (e.g., AJAX calls, fetching data).
- Inspect request headers, responses, timing, and identify potential issues.

### Performance tab

- Profile your JavaScript code to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Analyze CPU usage, memory allocation, and rendering times.
