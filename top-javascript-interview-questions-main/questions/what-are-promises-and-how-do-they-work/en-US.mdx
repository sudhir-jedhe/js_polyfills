title: What are Promises and how do they work?

## TL;DR

Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They have three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`. You can handle the results of a promise using the `.then()` method for success and the `.catch()` method for errors.

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // asynchronous operation
  if (/* operation successful */) {
    resolve('Success!');
  } else {
    reject('Error!');
  }
});

promise.then(result => {
  console.log(result); // 'Success!'
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error); // 'Error!'
});
```

## What are Promises and how do they work?

### Definition

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They provide a cleaner, more readable way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.

### States of a Promise

A promise can be in one of three states:

- `Pending`: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- `Fulfilled`: The operation completed successfully.
- `Rejected`: The operation failed.

### Creating a Promise

You create a promise using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function with two arguments: `resolve` and `reject`. These are callbacks that you call to change the state of the promise.

```js
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // asynchronous operation
  if (/* operation successful */) {
    resolve('Success!');
  } else {
    reject('Error!');
  }
});
```

### Handling a Promise

To handle the result of a promise, you use the `.then()` method for a successful outcome and the `.catch()` method for an error.

```js
promise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // 'Success!'
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // 'Error!'
  });
```

### Chaining Promises

Promises can be chained to handle multiple asynchronous operations in sequence. Each `.then()` returns a new promise, allowing for further chaining.

```js
promise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
    return anotherPromise;
  })
  .then((anotherResult) => {
    console.log(anotherResult);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

### Combining Promises

You can use `Promise.all()` to run multiple promises in parallel and wait for all of them to complete.

```js
let promise1 = Promise.resolve('First');
let promise2 = Promise.resolve('Second');

Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((results) => {
  console.log(results); // ['First', 'Second']
});
```
