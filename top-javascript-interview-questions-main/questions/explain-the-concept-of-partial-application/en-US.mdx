title: Explain the concept of partial application
---

## TL;DR

Partial application is a technique in functional programming where a function is applied to some of its arguments, producing a new function that takes the remaining arguments. This allows you to create more specific functions from general ones. For example, if you have a function `add(a, b)`, you can partially apply it to create a new function `add5` that always adds 5 to its argument.

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const add5 = add.bind(null, 5);
console.log(add5(10)); // Outputs 15
```

## Partial application

Partial application is a functional programming technique where a function is applied to some of its arguments, producing a new function that takes the remaining arguments. This can be useful for creating more specific functions from general ones, improving code reusability and readability.

### Example

Consider a simple `add` function that takes two arguments:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Using partial application, you can create a new function `add5` that always adds 5 to its argument:

```js
const add5 = add.bind(null, 5);
console.log(add5(10)); // Outputs 15
```

### How it works

In the example above, `add.bind(null, 5)` creates a new function where the first argument (`a`) is fixed to 5. The `null` value is used as the `this` context, which is not relevant in this case.

### Benefits

- **Code reusability**: You can create more specific functions from general ones, making your code more modular and reusable.
- **Readability**: Partially applied functions can make your code easier to read and understand by reducing the number of arguments you need to pass around.

### Real-world example

Partial application is often used in libraries like Lodash. For example, Lodash's `_.partial` function allows you to create partially applied functions easily:

```js
const _ = require('lodash');

function greet(greeting, name) {
  return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
}

const sayHelloTo = _.partial(greet, 'Hello');
console.log(sayHelloTo('John')); // Outputs "Hello, John!"
```
