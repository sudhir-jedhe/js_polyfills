title: How can you optimize network requests for better performance?
---

## TL;DR

To optimize network requests for better performance, you can minimize the number of requests, use caching, compress data, and leverage modern web technologies like HTTP/2 and service workers. For example, you can combine multiple CSS files into one to reduce the number of requests, use `Cache-Control` headers to cache static assets, and enable Gzip compression on your server to reduce the size of the data being transferred.

## How can you optimize network requests for better performance?

### Minimize the number of requests

Reducing the number of network requests can significantly improve performance. Here are some strategies:

- **Combine files**: Merge multiple CSS or JavaScript files into a single file.
- **Image sprites**: Combine multiple images into a single sprite sheet and use CSS to display the correct part of the image.
- **Inline small assets**: Use data URIs to inline small images or fonts directly into your CSS or HTML.

### Use caching

Caching can reduce the need to make network requests for resources that have not changed:

- **HTTP caching**: Use `Cache-Control` and `ETag` headers to control how and when resources are cached by the browser.
- **Service workers**: Implement service workers to cache assets and API responses, allowing your app to work offline and load faster on subsequent visits.

### Compress data

Reducing the size of the data being transferred can speed up network requests:

- **Gzip/Brotli compression**: Enable Gzip or Brotli compression on your server to compress HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Minification**: Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files to remove unnecessary characters and reduce file size.

### Leverage modern web technologies

Modern web technologies can help optimize network performance:

- **HTTP/2**: Use HTTP/2 to take advantage of multiplexing, header compression, and server push, which can reduce latency and improve load times.
- **CDNs**: Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve static assets from locations closer to the user, reducing latency.

### Optimize images

Images often account for a large portion of the data transferred:

- **Responsive images**: Use the `srcset` attribute to serve different image sizes based on the user's device.
- **Image formats**: Use modern image formats like WebP or AVIF, which offer better compression than traditional formats like JPEG or PNG.
- **Lazy loading**: Implement lazy loading to defer loading images until they are needed.

### Reduce payload size

Reducing the amount of data sent in each request can improve performance:

- **API optimization**: Optimize API responses to include only the necessary data.
- **GraphQL**: Use GraphQL to request only the specific data needed by the client.
