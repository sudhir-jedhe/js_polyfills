## TL;DR

I organize my code by following a modular approach, using a clear folder structure, and adhering to coding standards and best practices. I separate concerns by dividing code into different layers such as components, services, and utilities. I also use naming conventions and documentation to ensure code readability and maintainability.

## How do you organize your code?

### Modular approach

I follow a modular approach to break down the application into smaller, reusable pieces. This helps in managing the codebase more efficiently and makes it easier to maintain and scale.

### Folder structure

I use a clear and consistent folder structure to organize my code. Here is a common structure for a React project:

```
src/
|-- components/
|   |-- Header/
|   |   |-- Header.js
|   |   |-- Header.css
|   |-- Footer/
|   |   |-- Footer.js
|   |   |-- Footer.css
|-- services/
|   |-- apiService.js
|-- utils/
|   |-- helpers.js
|-- App.js
|-- index.js
```

### Separation of concerns

I separate concerns by dividing the code into different layers:

- **Components**: UI elements that are reusable and self-contained
- **Services**: Functions that handle data fetching and business logic
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and constants that can be used across the application

### Naming conventions

I use consistent naming conventions to improve code readability:

- **Files and folders**: Use camelCase or kebab-case for file and folder names
- **Components**: Use PascalCase for React component names
- **Variables and functions**: Use camelCase for variable and function names

### Documentation

I document my code to make it easier for others (and myself) to understand:

- **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic or important sections of the code
- **README**: Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project

### Coding standards and best practices

I adhere to coding standards and best practices to ensure code quality:

- **Linting**: Use tools like ESLint to enforce coding standards
- **Formatting**: Use tools like Prettier to maintain consistent code formatting
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability
