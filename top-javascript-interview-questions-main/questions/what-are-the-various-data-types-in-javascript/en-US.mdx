title: What are the various data types in JavaScript?
---

## TL;DR

In JavaScript, data types can be categorized into `primitive` and `non-primitive` types:

**Primitive data types**

- **Number**: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
- **String**: Represents sequences of characters.
- **Boolean**: Represents `true` or `false` values.
- **Undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **Symbol**: A unique and immutable value used as object property keys. Read more in our [deep dive on `Symbol`s](/questions/quiz/what-are-symbols-used-for)
- **BigInt**: Represents integers with arbitrary precision.

**Non-primitive (Reference) data types**

- **Object**: Used to store collections of data.
- **Array**: An ordered collection of data.
- **Function**: A callable object.
- **Date**: Represents dates and times.
- **RegExp**: Represents regular expressions.
- **Map**: A collection of keyed data items.
- **Set**: A collection of unique values.

The primitive types store a single value, while non-primitive types can store collections of data or complex entities.

## Data types in JavaScript

JavaScript, like many programming languages, has a variety of data types to represent different kinds of data. The main data types in JavaScript can be divided into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (reference) types.

### Primitive data types

1. **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. JavaScript only has one type of number.

```js
let age = 25;
let price = 99.99;
```

2. **String**: Represents sequences of characters. `Strings` can be enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or backticks (for template literals).

```js
let name = 'John Doe';
let greeting = 'Hello, world!';
let message = `Welcome, ${name}!`;
```

3. **Boolean**: Represents logical entities and can have two values: `true` or `false`.

```js
let isActive = true;
let isOver18 = false;
```

4. **Undefined**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value is of type `undefined`.

```js
let user;
console.log(user); // undefined
```

5. **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a primitive value and is treated as a falsy value.

```js
let user = null;
```

6. **Symbol**: A unique and immutable `primitive` value, typically used as the key of an object property.

```js
let sym1 = Symbol();
let sym2 = Symbol('description');
```

7. **BigInt**: Used for representing integers with arbitrary precision, useful for working with very large numbers.

```js
let bigNumber = BigInt(9007199254740991);
let anotherBigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

### Non-primitive (reference) data types

1. **Object**: It is used to store collections of data and more complex entities. `Objects` are created using curly braces `{}`.

```js
let person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
};
```

2. **Array**: A special type of object used for storing ordered collections of data. `Arrays` are created using square brackets `[]`.

```js
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

3. **Function**: `Functions` in JavaScript are `objects`. They can be defined using function declarations or expressions.

```js
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

let add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

4. **Date**: Represents dates and times. The `Date` object is used to work with dates.

```js
let today = new Date();
```

5. **RegExp**: Represents regular expressions, which are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.

```js
let pattern = /abc/;
```

6. **Map**: A collection of keyed data items, similar to an `object` but allows keys of any type.

```js
let map = new Map();
map.set('key1', 'value1');
```

7. **Set**: A collection of unique values.

```js
let set = new Set();
set.add(1);
set.add(2);
```

## Determining data types

JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means variables can hold values of different data types over time. The `typeof` operator can be used to determine the data type of a value or variable.

```js
console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof 'hello'); // "string"
console.log(typeof true); // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // "object" (this is a historical bug in JavaScript)
console.log(typeof Symbol()); // "symbol"
console.log(typeof BigInt(123)); // "bigint"
console.log(typeof {}); // "object"
console.log(typeof []); // "object"
console.log(typeof function () {}); // "function"
```

## Pitfalls

### Type coercion

JavaScript often performs type coercion, converting values from one type to another, which can lead to unexpected results.

```js
let result = '5' + 2; // '52' (string concatenation)
let difference = '5' - 2; // 3 (numeric subtraction)
```

In the first example, since strings can be concatenated with the `+` operator, the number is converted into a string and the two strings are concatenated together. In the second example, strings cannot work with the minus operator (`-`), but two numbers can be minused, so the string is first converted into a number and the result is the difference.
