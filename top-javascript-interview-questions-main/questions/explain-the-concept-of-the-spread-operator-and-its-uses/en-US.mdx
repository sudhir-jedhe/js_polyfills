title: Explain the concept of the spread operator and its uses
---

## TL;DR

The spread operator (`...`) in JavaScript allows you to expand elements of an iterable (like an array or object) into individual elements. It is commonly used for copying arrays or objects, merging arrays or objects, and passing elements of an array as arguments to a function.

```js
// Copying an array
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1];

// Merging arrays
const arr3 = [4, 5, 6];
const mergedArray = [...arr1, ...arr3];

// Copying an object
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };

// Merging objects
const obj3 = { c: 3, d: 4 };
const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj3 };

// Passing array elements as function arguments
const sum = (x, y, z) => x + y + z;
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(sum(...numbers)); // Output: 6
```

## The spread operator and its uses

### Copying arrays

The spread operator can be used to create a shallow copy of an array. This is useful when you want to duplicate an array without affecting the original array.

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1];
console.log(arr2); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Merging arrays

You can use the spread operator to merge multiple arrays into one. This is a concise and readable way to combine arrays.

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr3 = [4, 5, 6];
const mergedArray = [...arr1, ...arr3];
console.log(mergedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Copying objects

Similar to arrays, the spread operator can be used to create a shallow copy of an object. This is useful for duplicating objects without affecting the original object.

```js
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };
console.log(obj2); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2 }
```

### Merging objects

The spread operator can also be used to merge multiple objects into one. This is particularly useful for combining properties from different objects.

```js
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj3 = { c: 3, d: 4 };
const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj3 };
console.log(mergedObject); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }
```

### Passing array elements as function arguments

The spread operator allows you to pass elements of an array as individual arguments to a function. This is useful for functions that accept multiple arguments.

```js
const sum = (x, y, z) => x + y + z;
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(sum(...numbers)); // Output: 6
```
