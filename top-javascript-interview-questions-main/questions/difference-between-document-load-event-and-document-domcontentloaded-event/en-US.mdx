title: Difference between document `load` event and document `DOMContentLoaded` event?
---

## TL;DR

The `DOMContentLoaded` event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. The `load` event, on the other hand, fires when the entire page, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images, has finished loading.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
  console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
});

window.addEventListener('load', function () {
  console.log('Page fully loaded');
});
```

## Difference between document `load` event and document `DOMContentLoaded` event

### `DOMContentLoaded` event

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. This event is useful when you want to execute JavaScript code as soon as the DOM is ready, without waiting for all resources to be fully loaded.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
  console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
});
```

### `load` event

The `load` event is fired when the entire page, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, images, and subframes, has finished loading. This event is useful when you need to perform actions that require all resources to be fully loaded, such as initializing a slideshow or performing layout calculations that depend on image sizes.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('load', function () {
  console.log('Page fully loaded');
});
```

### Key differences

- **Timing**: `DOMContentLoaded` fires earlier than `load`. `DOMContentLoaded` occurs after the HTML is fully parsed, while `load` waits for all resources to be loaded.
- **Use cases**: Use `DOMContentLoaded` for tasks that only require the DOM to be ready, such as attaching event listeners or manipulating the DOM. Use `load` for tasks that depend on all resources being fully loaded, such as image-dependent layout calculations.
