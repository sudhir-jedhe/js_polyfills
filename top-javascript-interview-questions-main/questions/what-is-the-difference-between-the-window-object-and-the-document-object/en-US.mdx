title: What is the difference between the Window object and the Document object?
---

## TL;DR

The `Window` object represents the browser window and provides methods to control it, such as opening new windows or accessing the browser history. The `Document` object represents the content of the web page loaded in the window and provides methods to manipulate the DOM, such as selecting elements or modifying their content.

## Difference between the Window object and the Document object

### Window object

The `Window` object is the global object in a web browser environment. It represents the browser window or frame that contains a DOM document. Here are some key points about the `Window` object:

- It provides methods to control the browser window, such as `window.open()`, `window.close()`, and `window.alert()`.
- It gives access to the browser's history through `window.history`.
- It allows interaction with the browser's location (URL) via `window.location`.
- It can be used to set and clear timers with `window.setTimeout()` and `window.setInterval()`.
- It is the global execution context, meaning all global variables and functions are properties of the `Window` object.

Example:

```js
// Open a new window
window.open('https://www.example.com');

// Display an alert
window.alert('Hello, world!');
```

### Document object

The `Document` object represents the HTML or XML document loaded in the browser window. It is a property of the `Window` object (`window.document`). Here are some key points about the `Document` object:

- It provides methods to select elements, such as `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, and `document.getElementsByClassName()`.
- It allows manipulation of the DOM, including creating, removing, and modifying elements.
- It provides properties to access the document's metadata, such as `document.title` and `document.URL`.
- It can be used to listen for and handle events within the document.

Example:

```js
// Select an element by its ID
const element = document.getElementById('myElement');

// Change the content of the selected element
element.textContent = 'New content';
```

### Key differences

- The `Window` object represents the browser window, while the `Document` object represents the content of the web page.
- The `Window` object provides methods to control the browser window and interact with the browser environment, whereas the `Document` object provides methods to manipulate the DOM and interact with the content of the web page.
- The `Window` object is the global execution context, meaning all global variables and functions are properties of the `Window` object. The `Document` object is a property of the `Window` object.
