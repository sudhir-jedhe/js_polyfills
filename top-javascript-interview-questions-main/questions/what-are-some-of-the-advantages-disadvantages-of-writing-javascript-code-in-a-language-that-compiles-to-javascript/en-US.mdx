title: What are some of the advantages/disadvantages of writing JavaScript code in a language that compiles to JavaScript?
---

## TL;DR

Using languages that compile to JavaScript, like TypeScript or CoffeeScript, can offer several advantages such as improved syntax, type safety, and better tooling. However, they also come with disadvantages like added build steps, potential performance overhead, and the need to learn new syntax.

Advantages:

- Improved syntax and readability
- Type safety and error checking
- Better tooling and editor support

Disadvantages:

- Added build steps and complexity
- Potential performance overhead
- Learning curve for new syntax

## Advantages of writing JavaScript code in a language that compiles to JavaScript

### Improved syntax and readability

Languages like TypeScript and CoffeeScript often provide a more concise and readable syntax compared to vanilla JavaScript. This can make the code easier to write and maintain.

```typescript
// TypeScript example
class Person {
  constructor(private name: string) {}

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```

### Type safety and error checking

TypeScript, for example, adds static type checking to JavaScript, which can catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime. This can lead to more robust and reliable code.

```typescript
// TypeScript example
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Better tooling and editor support

Languages that compile to JavaScript often come with enhanced tooling and editor support, such as autocompletion, refactoring tools, and better debugging capabilities. This can improve developer productivity.

## Disadvantages of writing JavaScript code in a language that compiles to JavaScript

### Added build steps and complexity

Using a language that compiles to JavaScript introduces an additional build step in the development process. This can complicate the build pipeline and increase the time it takes to see changes reflected in the browser.

```json
// Example of a build configuration for TypeScript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

### Potential performance overhead

While the compiled JavaScript code is often optimized, there can be cases where the performance is not as good as hand-written JavaScript. This is especially true if the compiler introduces unnecessary abstractions.

### Learning curve for new syntax

Developers need to learn the new syntax and features of the language that compiles to JavaScript. This can be a barrier to entry and may require additional training and resources.
