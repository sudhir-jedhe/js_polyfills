In the context of web accessibility, both the **`<button>`** element and the **`role="button"`** attribute are used to create interactive elements, but they serve slightly different purposes and are applied in different scenarios.

### 1. **`<button>` Element**

The `<button>` element is a standard HTML element that is semantically used to represent a button on a webpage. It is inherently interactive and provides a number of built-in features that help make it accessible.

#### Key Features:
- **Semantic HTML**: Using the `<button>` element gives clear meaning to both users and assistive technologies (like screen readers) that this element is intended to be a clickable button.
- **Keyboard Interaction**: It is focusable by default and can be activated by pressing the `Enter` or `Space` keys.
- **Styling**: It can be styled using CSS and supports events like `click`, `focus`, `blur`, etc.

#### Example:
```html
<button onClick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

#### Accessibility:
- **Automatically Focusable**: The `<button>` element is automatically focusable, so users can navigate to it using the `Tab` key.
- **Keyboard Accessible**: It responds to both the `Enter` and `Space` keys by default.
- **Screen Reader Friendly**: Screen readers will announce it as a "button" without requiring additional ARIA attributes.

### 2. **`role="button"` (ARIA Role)**

The `role="button"` attribute is used to make an element behave like a button when the element is not inherently a button (like a `<div>`, `<span>`, or `<a>`). This is often used for custom or non-semantic elements that need to function as buttons, but are not actually `<button>` elements.

#### Key Features:
- **Non-semantic Elements**: The `role="button"` attribute is often applied to elements that aren't `<button>`, like `div`, `span`, or `a`, to indicate that they should be treated as buttons.
- **Keyboard and Focus Management**: When using `role="button"`, you must manually manage the keyboard interaction (`Enter` or `Space` to activate) and focus behavior, as the element doesn't automatically inherit button-like behavior.
- **ARIA Requirements**: When you use `role="button"`, you typically need to ensure that the element has proper keyboard support (such as adding event handlers for keyboard events) and focus indicators for accessibility.

#### Example:
```html
<div role="button" tabindex="0" onClick="alert('Custom button clicked!')" onKeyPress="if(event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') alert('Custom button clicked!')">
  Custom Button
</div>
```

#### Accessibility Considerations:
- **`role="button"`**: This informs screen readers that the element should be treated as a button. However, it doesn't automatically provide button behavior, so you need to handle keyboard interactions.
- **`tabindex="0"`**: Makes the element focusable via the keyboard (so it can be navigated to with the `Tab` key).
- **Keyboard Interaction**: You must manually handle keyboard events like `Enter` and `Space` if the element is a non-button element. In the example above, the `onKeyPress` event listener ensures that the button can be activated with `Enter` or `Space`.

### **Key Differences Between `<button>` and `role="button"`**

| Feature                  | `<button>` Element                           | `role="button"` (ARIA Role)                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Semantic Meaning**      | Clearly indicates a button by default        | Must be applied to non-semantic elements (like `div`, `span`, etc.) |
| **Accessibility**         | Fully accessible out of the box (focusable, keyboard accessible, announced as a button) | Requires manual implementation of keyboard navigation and focus management |
| **Keyboard Support**      | Native keyboard interaction (`Enter`, `Space`) | Needs manual handling of keyboard interactions (e.g., `Enter`, `Space`) |
| **Focus Management**      | Focusable by default, with focus outline     | Must use `tabindex="0"` to make it focusable     |
| **Use Case**              | Used for native buttons                      | Used for custom components (like div or span) to act as buttons |
| **Events**                | Supports `click`, `focus`, `blur`, etc. by default | Must manually handle events (e.g., `onClick`, `onKeyPress`) |

### **When to Use Each:**

- **Use `<button>` when**:  
  You are creating a native button for form submissions, clicks, etc., and want to make sure it's accessible without additional ARIA attributes. This is the preferred method whenever possible.
  
- **Use `role="button"` when**:  
  You are creating a custom element (such as a `div`, `span`, or `a` element) that you want to behave like a button. This is often the case in more complex or custom UI components where you need to visually style elements like buttons but donâ€™t want to use a `<button>` element.

---

### Example: Accessible Custom Button (Using `role="button"`)

```html
<!-- Custom element styled to act as a button -->
<div role="button" tabindex="0" onClick="alert('Custom button clicked!')" onKeyDown="if(event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') alert('Custom button clicked!')">
  Custom Button
</div>
```

In this case:
- **`role="button"`** tells screen readers that this element behaves like a button.
- **`tabindex="0"`** makes the `div` focusable with the `Tab` key.
- **`onKeyDown`** listens for `Enter` and `Space` key presses, allowing keyboard users to activate the button.

---

### Conclusion:

- **`<button>`**: Use this for any button-like interaction. It is the most accessible option because it automatically provides keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support.
  
- **`role="button"`**: Use this for non-semantic or custom elements that need to function as buttons. Be sure to add additional keyboard support and focus management to ensure accessibility.
