The goal of `flattenThunk` is to allow you to handle a chain of functions that return other functions (thunks). It takes a thunk (a function that takes a callback) as an argument, and it returns a new thunk that flattens this chain of thunks, making it easier to handle a sequence of asynchronous operations, especially when each step might return another function (or a result).

Let's break it down:

### Problem Breakdown

You have thunks like `func3`, `func2`, and `func1` that are chained in a way where each function may return another function (another thunk) or a result (data). If the result is another thunk, it should be invoked, and if it's a final result (data), the process should end.

Here’s an overview of what happens:

- **Thunk**: A function that takes a callback.
- **Callback**: A function that takes an error and data, where data can either be a final result or another thunk.
- **Flattening**: If the data is a function (i.e., a thunk), invoke it with the same callback. If it's not a function, it's a result and should be passed back to the original callback.

### Solution

Here’s how you can implement `flattenThunk`:

1. **Callback Handling**: The callback passed to the returned function must handle two cases:
    - If an error occurs, immediately call the callback with the error.
    - If the data is a function (another thunk), invoke it with the same callback.
    - If the data is a value (not a function), pass it to the callback as the result.

2. **Chaining Thunks**: The main purpose of `flattenThunk` is to chain functions that may return other functions, so you need to recursively handle the case where the result is a function.

### Code Explanation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {Thunk} thunk
 * @return {Thunk}
 */
function flattenThunk(thunk) {
  return function(callback) {
    // Wrap the callback to handle each case (error, data, or thunk)
    const callbackWrapper = (err, data) => {
      // If there's an error, immediately call the callback with the error
      if (err) {
        callback(err);
      } 
      // If the data is a function (another thunk), call it with the same callback
      else if (typeof data === 'function') {
        data(callbackWrapper);
      } 
      // If data is a value, return it to the original callback
      else {
        callback(err, data);
      }
    };

    // Call the original thunk with the callbackWrapper
    thunk(callbackWrapper);
  };
}
```

### Example Usage

Let’s break down the usage with the example provided in the question:

```javascript
// func1, func2, func3 are thunks that return each other in a chain

const func1 = (cb) => {
  setTimeout(() => cb(null, 'ok'), 10); // Simulates an async operation returning "ok"
};

const func2 = (cb) => {
  setTimeout(() => cb(null, func1), 10); // Returns func1 as a thunk
};

const func3 = (cb) => {
  setTimeout(() => cb(null, func2), 10); // Returns func2 as a thunk
};

// Flatten the thunks using flattenThunk
flattenThunk(func3)((error, data) => {
  console.log(data); // Output: 'ok'
});
```

### Detailed Execution Flow

1. **`func3`** is invoked first.
   - `func3` calls its callback with `null` as the error and `func2` as the data.
   
2. **Callback for `func3`** (i.e., `callbackWrapper`) is invoked with `func2`. Since `func2` is a function (a thunk), `callbackWrapper` calls `func2` with itself (`callbackWrapper`) as the new callback.

3. **`func2`** is invoked.
   - `func2` calls its callback with `null` as the error and `func1` as the data.
   
4. **Callback for `func2`** (i.e., `callbackWrapper`) is invoked with `func1`. Since `func1` is a function (a thunk), `callbackWrapper` calls `func1` with itself (`callbackWrapper`) as the new callback.

5. **`func1`** is invoked.
   - `func1` calls its callback with `null` as the error and `'ok'` as the data.

6. **Callback for `func1`** is invoked with `'ok'`. Since `'ok'` is a final value (not a thunk), it is passed to the original callback, which prints `'ok'`.

### Key Concepts
- **Recursive Thunk Handling**: `flattenThunk` allows each function in the chain to return another function (a thunk). It recursively "unwraps" these thunks and passes the callback until the final result is reached.
- **Error Handling**: As soon as an error occurs at any step in the chain, the rest of the thunks are skipped, and the error is propagated to the callback.

### Edge Cases
1. **Error Handling**: If any of the thunks (e.g., `func1`, `func2`, `func3`) call the callback with an error, the chain is immediately broken, and the error is passed to the final callback.
2. **Non-thunk Values**: If a thunk returns a non-function (i.e., a final result), it’s passed back to the original callback.

### Conclusion

This solution allows you to flatten chained thunks into a single, easy-to-use callback-based flow. It provides robust handling for asynchronous functions that may return other functions, making it useful for scenarios where you have deeply nested asynchronous operations.
