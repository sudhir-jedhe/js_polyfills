Let's break down the two pieces of code you've shared and explain what will happen when they're executed.

---

### 1. **The first code snippet**

```javascript
const a = (1, 2, 3);
console.log(a);
```

#### **Explanation:**

In JavaScript, the **comma operator** evaluates each operand from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. So, in this case:

- The expression `(1, 2, 3)` evaluates the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` in sequence, but **only the value `3`** is returned.
- Therefore, `a` will be assigned the value `3`.

#### **What happens when you run the code?**

```javascript
console.log(a);  // Outputs: 3
```

So the output will be `3`.

### 2. **The second code snippet**

```javascript
var obj = {
  a: "BFE",
  b: "dev",
  func:
    (function foo() {
      return this.a;
    },
    function bar() {
      return this.b;
    }),
};

console.log(obj.func());
```

#### **Explanation:**

This part involves a **comma operator** and a function assignment. Let's break it down:

- `func` is assigned the result of the **comma operator**, which evaluates two functions (`foo` and `bar`).
- **Comma operator behavior**: 
  - `function foo()` returns `this.a` (but we'll see what `this` refers to in a moment).
  - `function bar()` returns `this.b` (similarly, we'll check what `this` refers to here too).
  - The **comma operator** returns the value of the second function (`bar`), which will be assigned to `obj.func`.

Thus, `obj.func` is actually the `bar` function, and when we invoke `obj.func()`, it will call `bar()`.

#### **What happens with `this`?**

- The value of `this` inside a function depends on how the function is called.
  - **In the `bar` function**: When we call `obj.func()`, `this` refers to the **global context** (in non-strict mode, `this` will refer to the global object, which is `window` in a browser).
  - Since `this` refers to the global object, **`this.b`** will be `undefined`, as there is no `b` property on the global object.

#### **What happens when you run the code?**

Since `this` inside `bar()` refers to the global context (and not `obj`), `this.b` will be `undefined`.

```javascript
console.log(obj.func());  // Outputs: undefined
```

---

### Final Output:

The final output will be:

```
3        // From the first code snippet
undefined // From the second code snippet, because `this` refers to the global context
```

---

### **Summary:**

- The first snippet demonstrates how the **comma operator** returns the last value in the sequence.
- The second snippet shows how **`this`** behaves in a function assigned using the comma operator, where it refers to the global context in non-strict mode, resulting in `undefined` when trying to access `this.b`.
