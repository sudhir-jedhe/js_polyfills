The code you provided defines a function `sum` that allows chaining of function calls to continuously add numbers and retrieves the final sum using the `.valueOf()` method. Let's break down and explain the mechanics of this solution.

### Explanation

#### 1. **Initial Function Definition:**
The `sum` function takes a number `num` and returns a function (`func` or `fn`), which allows the addition of subsequent numbers. The goal is to keep adding numbers as long as the function is invoked.

```js
function sum(num) {
    const func = function(num2) { // #4
        return num2 !== undefined ? sum(num + num2) : num; // #3
    }
    
    func.valueOf = () => num; // #2
    return func; // #1
}
```

#### Key Points:

- **#4:** The returned function (`func` or `fn`) takes another number `num2` and adds it to the running total (`num`). If `num2` is provided, it recursively calls `sum(num + num2)` to accumulate the sum.
  
- **#3:** If `num2` is `undefined` (i.e., no argument is passed), it returns the current value of `num`, which represents the final sum. This is the base case that ends the recursion when no additional numbers are supplied.

- **#2:** The `valueOf` method is overridden to allow for implicit type coercion when the function `func` is used in an expression that expects a number. For example, when the function is involved in a `console.log`, the `valueOf` method ensures that it returns the correct result (the accumulated sum).

- **#1:** The function returns the `func` function, allowing chaining.

### Example Use Case:

Let's go through an example:

```js
console.log("RETURN", sum(2)(2)(5, 6).valueOf()) // 15
```

- `sum(2)` starts the sum with the value `2`.
- `sum(2)` is called again, which adds `2` to the running sum, so the value becomes `4`.
- `sum(5, 6)` adds `5` and `6` to the current sum, so the total becomes `15`.
  
The final result is `15`.

#### How `.valueOf()` Works:

- When `sum(2)(2)(5, 6)` is invoked, it returns a function. At each step, the function returns a new function, accumulating the sum along the way.
- The `valueOf` method is called when `sum(2)(2)(5, 6)` is coerced into a primitive value (i.e., when the function is evaluated as a number). It retrieves the accumulated value (`15` in this case) and returns it.

### Alternative Implementations:

There are different ways to implement this concept of chaining and accumulation. You can modify how numbers are passed, or you can use a more functional approach like reducing an array of numbers.

Here is a breakdown of another implementation that uses `Symbol.toPrimitive` for coercion instead of `valueOf`:

```js
function sum(num) {
    const fn = (b) => sum(num + b);
    fn[Symbol.toPrimitive] = () => num; // Overriding the Symbol.toPrimitive
    return fn;
}
```

This implementation uses the `Symbol.toPrimitive` symbol to control how the function behaves when it needs to be converted to a primitive value (e.g., a number). It achieves a similar result but with a more modern approach to handling type coercion.

### Performance and Readability:

While the recursive approach works, using the `.valueOf` or `Symbol.toPrimitive` for coercion allows you to achieve a more compact and readable solution. However, this is a clever and interesting pattern, especially for practicing function chaining and implicit type coercion in JavaScript.

### Final Code:
```js
function sum(num) {
    const func = (...args) => {
        // If arguments exist, continue the sum by adding to num
        return args.length > 0
            ? sum(num + args.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0))
            : num;
    };

    // Overriding valueOf to return the final result when coercing to number
    func.valueOf = () => num;
    return func;
}

console.log("RETURN", sum(2)(2)(5, 6).valueOf()); // 15
```

### Summary:

- The `sum` function returns a chainable function that accumulates a sum.
- The function uses recursion to keep adding numbers.
- The `.valueOf` or `Symbol.toPrimitive` methods enable the function to return the final sum when it is coerced into a number.
