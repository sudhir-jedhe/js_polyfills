To implement a deep clone function that works for JavaScript objects containing JSON-serializable values, we can use recursion. Since you're specifically asking for the deep cloning of objects without dealing with other complex data types like `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, etc., we can focus on handling the basic types (null, boolean, number, string, arrays, and plain objects) and make sure that the cloned object is fully independent of the original object.

Hereâ€™s how we can implement `deepClone`:

### Solution

```js
function deepClone(value) {
  // If the value is not an object or is null, return it directly (primitive values).
  if (value === null || typeof value !== 'object') {
    return value;
  }

  // If the value is an array, we clone each element recursively.
  if (Array.isArray(value)) {
    return value.map(deepClone);
  }

  // If it's an object, we create a new object and copy all the properties.
  const clonedObj = {};

  // Iterate over all the object's properties.
  for (const key in value) {
    if (value.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      clonedObj[key] = deepClone(value[key]);
    }
  }

  return clonedObj;
}

// Test cases
const obj1 = { user: { role: "admin" } };
const clonedObj1 = deepClone(obj1);

clonedObj1.user.role = "guest"; // Change the cloned user's role to 'guest'.
console.log(clonedObj1.user.role); // 'guest'
console.log(obj1.user.role); // Should still be 'admin'.

const obj2 = { foo: [{ bar: "baz" }] };
const clonedObj2 = deepClone(obj2);

obj2.foo[0].bar = "bax"; // Modify the original object.
console.log(obj2.foo[0].bar); // 'bax'
console.log(clonedObj2.foo[0].bar); // Should still be 'baz'.
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case for Primitives**: If the `value` is `null` or not an object (i.e., a primitive value like `string`, `number`, `boolean`), it is returned directly. This ensures that the function doesn't attempt to recursively deep clone primitive types.

2. **Array Handling**: If the value is an array, we use `Array.prototype.map()` to iterate over each element of the array and recursively call `deepClone` on each element. This ensures that arrays are deeply cloned, and no references to the original elements remain.

3. **Object Handling**: If the value is an object (excluding arrays, which we handle separately), we create a new object (`clonedObj`) and recursively clone each of its properties using a `for...in` loop. This ensures that nested objects are cloned deeply.

4. **Edge Case for `null`**: If the value is `null`, it's directly returned. This prevents errors from trying to access properties on `null`.

### Test Cases:

1. **Nested Object Cloning**:
   - We have `obj1` with a nested `user` object. After cloning, we modify the `role` property of the `user` object in the cloned object. The original object remains unaffected.
   
2. **Array Cloning**:
   - `obj2` contains an array with a nested object. We modify the array's nested object's property in the original, and the cloned object should not be affected.

### Output:

```js
'guest'   // Output for clonedObj1.user.role
'admin'   // Output for obj1.user.role
'bax'     // Output for obj2.foo[0].bar
'baz'     // Output for clonedObj2.foo[0].bar
```

### Notes:

- This deep cloning function will not handle non-serializable objects like `Date`, `RegExp`, `Map`, `Set`, or functions. If you need to handle those cases, you'd have to modify the function further, e.g., by checking the type of object and manually cloning `Date` or `RegExp`.
- The function works correctly for arrays and nested objects, as demonstrated in the test cases. It prevents shared references between the original and cloned objects, ensuring they are fully independent.
