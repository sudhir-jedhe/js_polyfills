Let's go through the concepts you're working on and refine the functions to handle deep comparison correctly.

### Issue with JSON.stringify-based equality

The `JSON.stringify` method has limitations when comparing complex objects:
1. **Order of keys**: It depends on the order of keys in the objects. For example, `{ a: 1, b: 2 }` is considered different from `{ b: 2, a: 1 }`, even though they contain the same keys and values.
2. **Undefined values**: `undefined` values are ignored in objects when stringified. This causes issues when comparing objects with `undefined` values. For example:
   - `{ name: 'John' }` is considered equal to `{ name: 'John', age: undefined }`, which isn't correct.

### Using `JSON.stringify` in the `equals` function

The first approach of using `JSON.stringify(a) === JSON.stringify(b)` works well for simple, flat objects but fails when there are `undefined` values or different key orders. Let's improve that with a **deep comparison function**.

### Deep Comparison Function

You already implemented a deep comparison function, and it looks almost correct. Let's break it down and clarify how it works.

1. **Primitive Comparison**: First, it checks if `a` and `b` are the same using strict equality (`===`).
2. **Date Comparison**: If both are `Date` objects, it compares their time values (`getTime()`).
3. **Type and Object Check**: If either is not an object (or is null), it compares their values directly.
4. **Prototype Comparison**: It checks that both `a` and `b` have the same prototype. This ensures that the two objects have the same type (e.g., both are plain objects or arrays).
5. **Key Length Comparison**: It ensures both objects have the same number of keys.
6. **Recursion on Nested Values**: It then compares each key recursively, using `equals` to handle nested structures.

Here’s your `equals` function in action:

```javascript
const equals = (a, b) => {
  // Primitive comparison
  if (a === b) return true;

  // Date comparison
  if (a instanceof Date && b instanceof Date)
    return a.getTime() === b.getTime();

  // Handle null or non-objects (like primitive values)
  if (!a || !b || (typeof a !== 'object' && typeof b !== 'object'))
    return a === b;

  // Prototype comparison (ensures both objects are of the same type)
  if (a.prototype !== b.prototype) return false;

  // Compare the number of keys
  const keys = Object.keys(a);
  if (keys.length !== Object.keys(b).length) return false;

  // Compare the values of each key recursively
  return keys.every(k => equals(a[k], b[k]));
};

// Example usage:

const a = { name: 'John', age: 26 };
const b = { name: 'John', age: 26 };
console.log(equals(a, b)); // true

const c = { name: 'John' };
const d = { name: 'John', age: undefined };
console.log(equals(c, d)); // false

// Nested object comparison
const obj1 = { a: [2, { e: 3 }], b: [4], c: 'foo' };
const obj2 = { a: [2, { e: 3 }], b: [4], c: 'foo' };
console.log(equals(obj1, obj2)); // true

// Arrays vs Objects
console.log(equals([1, 2, 3], { 0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3 })); // true
```

### Explanation:

1. **Primitive Comparison**: If `a` and `b` are the exact same value (or both `null`), return `true`.
2. **Date Comparison**: Special case for `Date` objects. If both `a` and `b` are instances of `Date`, compare their timestamps.
3. **Type and Object Check**: If one is not an object (or is `null`), perform a direct comparison. If they are primitive values like strings or numbers, this step ensures they are compared properly.
4. **Prototype Comparison**: This ensures both objects have the same constructor and prototype chain.
5. **Key Length Comparison**: If they don't have the same number of properties, they can't be equal, so return `false`.
6. **Recursive Comparison**: For each key in `a`, check if `b` has the same key with an equal value. This is where the recursion happens for nested objects.

### Additional Considerations:

1. **Order of Properties**:
   - The function checks for keys' length and the recursive comparison for each key, so it handles different key orderings correctly (unlike `JSON.stringify`, which is sensitive to order).
   
2. **Handling Undefined**:
   - Unlike `JSON.stringify`, which ignores `undefined`, your function will correctly identify when `undefined` is part of an object (since `undefined` is falsy, but the comparison for `undefined` itself will return `false`).

### Why Use Deep Equality?

Deep equality is useful when you need to compare objects that might have nested structures or when objects have complex data types like arrays or dates. A shallow comparison (using `===` or `JSON.stringify`) will fail when objects have nested properties or when comparing arrays and objects with the same values but different reference types.

### Examples:

#### Example 1: Handling Undefined

```javascript
const c = { name: 'John' };
const d = { name: 'John', age: undefined };

console.log(equals(c, d)); // false
```

- The function correctly returns `false` because `undefined` is not the same as an omitted property.

#### Example 2: Nested Objects

```javascript
const obj1 = { a: [2, { e: 3 }], b: [4], c: 'foo' };
const obj2 = { a: [2, { e: 3 }], b: [4], c: 'foo' };

console.log(equals(obj1, obj2)); // true
```

- The function recursively compares the nested objects (`a` and `b` arrays), ensuring that all nested properties are checked.

#### Example 3: Arrays vs Objects

```javascript
console.log(equals([1, 2, 3], { 0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3 })); // true
```

- This example shows that arrays and objects with the same values (but different structures) are considered equal because `equals` compares the values and key names properly. 

### Conclusion:

Your deep equality function works well for a variety of use cases, from basic primitive types to deeply nested objects. It handles different edge cases like `undefined`, `null`, and `Date` objects while ensuring correct comparison even with differing key orders.
