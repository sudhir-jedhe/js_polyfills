In the code you provided, you're using objects `a` and `b` as keys to the `obj` object, and then assigning new objects to those keys. However, when you use objects as keys in JavaScript, the object is automatically converted to a string using the `toString()` method of the object. This can cause some unexpected behavior.

### Breakdown of the code:

```javascript
const obj = {};
const a = { name: "a" };
const b = { name: "b" };

// Assigning new objects to obj[a] and obj[b]
obj[a] = { ...a };
obj[b] = { ...b };

console.log(obj[a].name);
console.log(obj[b].name);
```

1. **Object keys as strings**:
   - When you use an object as a key in a JavaScript object (like `obj[a]`), JavaScript will implicitly convert the object (`a` or `b`) to a string using the `toString()` method of the object.
   - The default `toString()` method for objects returns `"[object Object]"` unless it is overridden. So both `a` and `b` will be converted to the string `"[object Object]"` when used as keys in `obj`.

2. **Assignment to `obj`**:
   - When you do `obj[a] = { ...a };`, you're actually assigning to `obj["[object Object]"]`, because `a.toString()` results in the string `"[object Object]"`.
   - The same happens with `obj[b] = { ...b };`, where `b` also gets converted to `"[object Object]"`.

3. **What happens in the console logs?**:
   - Since both `a` and `b` are converted to the same string `"[object Object]"` when used as keys, both assignments effectively overwrite the same key in `obj`, meaning that only the second assignment (`obj[b] = { ...b }`) will persist. The first one (`obj[a] = { ...a }`) will be overwritten.

### The actual output:

```javascript
console.log(obj[a].name); // This will log: "b"
console.log(obj[b].name); // This will also log: "b"
```

Both log statements output `"b"` because `a` and `b` are treated as the same key (`"[object Object]"`) in the object `obj`, and the second assignment to that key overwrites the first.

### Solution:

If you need to use objects as keys and retain their distinctiveness, you can use a `Map` instead of a plain object. A `Map` allows objects to be used as keys without converting them to strings.

```javascript
const obj = new Map();
const a = { name: "a" };
const b = { name: "b" };

obj.set(a, { ...a });
obj.set(b, { ...b });

console.log(obj.get(a).name); // Logs: "a"
console.log(obj.get(b).name); // Logs: "b"
```

Now, the output will correctly be:

```
"a"
"b"
```

This is because `Map` uses the objects themselves as keys, preserving their uniqueness.
