Your code examples are focused on checking whether two objects (or arrays) are **deeply equal**—meaning that all properties and nested structures must match in value and structure. You've provided a few different implementations for deep equality checks, each with its own approach. I'll explain and review each solution, pointing out their strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements.

### **Example 1: Manual Deep Equality Check with Recursion**

```js
const isDeepEqual = (object1, object2) => {
  const objKeys1 = Object.keys(object1);
  const objKeys2 = Object.keys(object2);

  if (objKeys1.length !== objKeys2.length) return false;

  for (var key of objKeys1) {
    const value1 = object1[key];
    const value2 = object2[key];

    const isObjects = isObject(value1) && isObject(value2);

    if (
      (isObjects && !isDeepEqual(value1, value2)) ||
      (!isObjects && value1 !== value2)
    ) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
};

const isObject = (object) => {
  return object != null && typeof object === "object";
};

console.log(isDeepEqual(person1, person2)); // true
```

#### **How It Works:**
- **`isObject()`** checks if the given value is a non-null object.
- The function loops through the keys of both objects. If the number of keys differs, it immediately returns `false`.
- It then checks each key's value. If the values are objects themselves, it recursively calls `isDeepEqual()` on them. Otherwise, it compares the values directly.

#### **Pros:**
- Works well with any JavaScript object, including nested objects.
- Handles deep objects and primitive comparisons effectively.
- Handles arrays because they are objects in JavaScript and will be passed recursively.

#### **Cons:**
- Can be slow for large or deeply nested structures.
- Does not handle edge cases like functions, `Date` objects, or special objects (`Map`, `Set`, etc.).
- Does not support circular references, and will throw a stack overflow error if circular references exist.

#### **Improvement:**
Consider adding handling for edge cases, such as `Date`, `RegExp`, and other special types, or circular references.

### **Example 2: Using `JSON.stringify()`**

```js
const person1 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 35,
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 35,
};

JSON.stringify(person1) === JSON.stringify(person2); // true
```

#### **How It Works:**
- The objects are serialized into JSON strings using `JSON.stringify()`.
- If the serialized strings are the same, the objects are considered deeply equal.

#### **Pros:**
- Simple and fast for basic use cases where the objects only contain JSON-safe values.
- Easy to implement with minimal code.

#### **Cons:**
- It fails for objects that contain non-JSON-serializable data types (e.g., `undefined`, `function`, `Date`, `RegExp`, `Map`, `Set`, `Infinity`, etc.).
- The order of properties in objects matters when using `JSON.stringify()`. If properties are listed in a different order, even if the values are the same, the strings will differ.
- Doesn’t handle circular references.
- Not a true deep equality check, since object properties can have different types or nested structures.

### **Example 3: Deep Equality for Arrays and Objects**

```js
function areDeeplyEqual(obj1, obj2) {
  if (obj1 === obj2) return true;

  if (Array.isArray(obj1) && Array.isArray(obj2)) {
    if (obj1.length !== obj2.length) return false;

    return obj1.every((elem, index) => {
      return areDeeplyEqual(elem, obj2[index]);
    });
  }

  if (
    typeof obj1 === "object" &&
    typeof obj2 === "object" &&
    obj1 !== null &&
    obj2 !== null
  ) {
    if (Array.isArray(obj1) || Array.isArray(obj2)) return false;

    const keys1 = Object.keys(obj1);
    const keys2 = Object.keys(obj2);

    if (
      keys1.length !== keys2.length ||
      !keys1.every((key) => keys2.includes(key))
    )
      return false;

    for (let key in obj1) {
      let isEqual = areDeeplyEqual(obj1[key], obj2[key]);
      if (!isEqual) {
        return false;
      }
    }

    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```

#### **How It Works:**
- First, checks for direct reference equality (`obj1 === obj2`).
- If both are arrays, it compares their lengths and uses `Array.prototype.every()` to compare each element.
- If both are objects, it compares their keys and checks for deep equality of each corresponding key-value pair.
- Handles nested arrays and objects.

#### **Pros:**
- Handles arrays and objects well.
- Works recursively for deeply nested structures.
- Can handle objects with different keys, ensuring a comprehensive comparison.

#### **Cons:**
- Doesn’t handle special data types like `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, or functions.
- Slightly more complex and verbose than the previous examples.
- Performance can suffer for large nested structures, especially with the nested `for` loop and recursive calls.

#### **Improvement:**
- You might want to handle special objects like `Date` or `Map`. You could check for these types and handle them accordingly using `instanceof` checks.

### **Additional Thoughts:**

If you need to handle more complex scenarios (such as `Date`, `RegExp`, `Map`, `Set`, and circular references), you may want to consider using a more sophisticated deep equality function like `lodash`'s `_.isEqual()`.

```js
// Using lodash's isEqual function
import isEqual from 'lodash/isEqual';

const person1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 35 };
const person2 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 35 };

console.log(isEqual(person1, person2)); // true
```

`lodash`'s `_.isEqual()` takes care of many edge cases and handles non-serializable data types. It’s an excellent choice if you want a reliable, battle-tested solution.

---

### **Summary:**

1. **Manual Deep Comparison** (`isDeepEqual`): Great for basic, custom deep comparison. Can be extended to handle special cases.
2. **JSON Serialization** (`JSON.stringify()`): Fast and simple but unsuitable for non-JSON types and circular references.
3. **Recursive Deep Equality for Arrays and Objects**: More thorough and works well for nested arrays and objects, but still limited by handling special cases like `Date`, `Map`, etc.

If you're working in a production environment, consider using a library like `Lodash` or adding checks for special data types and circular references to ensure a comprehensive deep equality solution.
