The `ParkingSystem` class design you've provided works well and meets the requirements for handling the parking logic based on three types of parking spaces: big, medium, and small. Let's walk through the explanation and verify the correctness of your solution.

### **Class Explanation:**

#### **Attributes:**
- `count`: This is an array of three elements where:
  - `count[0]` stores the number of available big parking spaces.
  - `count[1]` stores the number of available medium parking spaces.
  - `count[2]` stores the number of available small parking spaces.
  
#### **Methods:**
- **`constructor(big: number, medium: number, small: number)`**: 
  - Initializes the `count` array with the respective values for big, medium, and small parking slots.
  
- **`addCar(carType: number): boolean`**:
  - Checks if a parking slot of the specified `carType` is available.
  - If the slot is available (i.e., `count[carType - 1] > 0`), it decrements the corresponding parking slot counter and returns `true`.
  - If no slot is available, it returns `false`.

### **Usage Example and Execution:**

Let's break down the input-output example to confirm how the solution works:

#### **Input:**
```json
["ParkingSystem", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar"]
[[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]
```

#### **Execution:**
1. **Create a new `ParkingSystem` object:**
   - `var obj = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0)`
   - This initializes the parking system with:
     - 1 big parking space
     - 1 medium parking space
     - 0 small parking spaces

2. **First `addCar(1)` call:**
   - This tries to add a big car (type 1).
   - The system checks `count[0]`, which is `1` (indicating one big space available).
   - The car is parked successfully, and the count for big spaces is reduced to `0`.
   - Returns `true`.

3. **Second `addCar(2)` call:**
   - This tries to add a medium car (type 2).
   - The system checks `count[1]`, which is `1` (indicating one medium space available).
   - The car is parked successfully, and the count for medium spaces is reduced to `0`.
   - Returns `true`.

4. **Third `addCar(3)` call:**
   - This tries to add a small car (type 3).
   - The system checks `count[2]`, which is `0` (indicating no small spaces available).
   - Since no small space is available, it returns `false`.

5. **Fourth `addCar(1)` call:**
   - This tries to add another big car (type 1).
   - The system checks `count[0]`, which is `0` (indicating no big spaces available).
   - Since no big space is available, it returns `false`.

#### **Output:**
```json
[null, true, true, false, false]
```

### **Final Solution:**
The implementation correctly follows the design pattern and provides the expected behavior. Here's the final code:

```typescript
class ParkingSystem {
    private count: [number, number, number];

    constructor(big: number, medium: number, small: number) {
        this.count = [big, medium, small];
    }

    addCar(carType: number): boolean {
        if (this.count[carType - 1] === 0) {
            return false; // No space available for the car type
        }
        this.count[carType - 1]--; // Decrease the available slot for the respective car type
        return true;
    }
}

/**
 * Your ParkingSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new ParkingSystem(big, medium, small)
 * var param_1 = obj.addCar(carType)
 */
```

### **Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The `addCar()` method performs a constant-time check and updates the array (both operations are O(1)). Thus, for each car, the time complexity is O(1).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(1) since we only store a fixed array of 3 elements (for big, medium, and small parking slots).

This implementation is optimal in terms of both time and space for the given problem.

### **Conclusion:**
Your solution is effective for managing the parking system with three types of parking spaces. It correctly implements the required logic, and the input-output example works as expected.
