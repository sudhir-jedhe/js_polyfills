### Comparing JavaScript Objects for Equality

As you rightly pointed out, JavaScript objects are reference types, which means comparing two objects by their properties and values requires some careful consideration. Here's a breakdown of how to approach object comparisons, both **one-sided** and **two-sided**, with or without custom value comparison functions.

### **1. One-sided Object Comparison**
The idea behind a one-sided comparison is to check if one object **matches** another, i.e., if all the properties of the second object are found in the first object with the same values. This doesn't check if the first object has additional keys.

#### **Basic Comparison (by value)**
The most straightforward way to compare two objects is by checking if all the properties of the second object are present in the first object and if their values are strictly equal (`===`).

```javascript
const matches = (obj, source) =>
  Object.keys(source).every(
    key => obj.hasOwnProperty(key) && obj[key] === source[key]
  );

console.log(matches(
  { age: 25, hair: 'long', beard: true },
  { hair: 'long', beard: true }
)); // true

console.log(matches(
  { hair: 'long', beard: true },
  { age: 25, hair: 'long', beard: true }
)); // false
```

Here, the first call to `matches` returns `true` because all keys in the `source` object are found in the `obj` object with equal values. The second call returns `false` because the `obj` is missing the `age` property.

#### **Comparison Using a Custom Function**
If you'd like to use a custom comparison for values instead of strict equality, you can pass a custom function to handle the comparison logic. This function is called for each property in the source object.

```javascript
const matchesWith = (obj, source, fn) =>
  Object.keys(source).every(
    key =>
      obj.hasOwnProperty(key) &&
      fn(obj[key], source[key], key, obj, source)
  );

const isGreeting = val => /^h(?:i|ello)$/.test(val);

console.log(matchesWith(
  { greeting: 'hello' },
  { greeting: 'hi' },
  (a, b) => isGreeting(a) && isGreeting(b)
)); // true
```

In this example, we use the `isGreeting` function to check if the values of the `greeting` property are valid greetings like `hello` or `hi`.

### **2. Two-sided Object Comparison**
A two-sided comparison checks if both objects have exactly the same properties and values, ensuring the key-value pairs are identical in both objects. This means checking if the **keys and values** of both objects match in both directions.

#### **Basic Two-sided Comparison (by value)**

```javascript
const matchesSymmetric = (a, b) => {
  const keysA = Object.keys(a),
    keysB = Object.keys(b);
  const keys = new Set([...keysA, ...keysB]); // Create a set of all unique keys from both objects
  if (keys.size !== keysA.length || keys.size !== keysB.length) return false;

  return [...keys].every(
    key => a.hasOwnProperty(key) && b.hasOwnProperty(key) && a[key] === b[key]
  );
};

console.log(matchesSymmetric(
  { age: 25, hair: 'long', beard: true },
  { hair: 'long', beard: true }
)); // false

console.log(matchesSymmetric(
  { hair: 'long', beard: true },
  { age: 25, hair: 'long', beard: true }
)); // false

console.log(matchesSymmetric(
  { age: 25, hair: 'long', beard: true },
  { age: 25, hair: 'long', beard: true }
)); // true
```

Here, `matchesSymmetric` returns `true` only if both objects have the same keys and values. For the first two comparisons, the keys donâ€™t match, so they return `false`. The third comparison returns `true` because both objects have exactly the same keys and values.

#### **Two-sided Comparison Using a Custom Function**

Just like with one-sided comparison, you can use a custom function to compare the values of properties.

```javascript
const matchesSymmetricWith = (a, b, fn) => {
  const keysA = Object.keys(a),
    keysB = Object.keys(b);
  const keys = new Set([...keysA, ...keysB]); // Create a set of all unique keys from both objects
  if (keys.size !== keysA.length || keys.size !== keysB.length) return false;

  return [...keys].every(
    key =>
      a.hasOwnProperty(key) &&
      b.hasOwnProperty(key) &&
      fn(a[key], b[key], key, a, b)
  );
};

const isGreeting = val => /^h(?:i|ello)$/.test(val);

console.log(matchesSymmetricWith(
  { greeting: 'hello', other: 2 },
  { greeting: 'hi' },
  (a, b) => isGreeting(a) && isGreeting(b)
)); // false

console.log(matchesSymmetricWith(
  { greeting: 'hello' },
  { greeting: 'hi' },
  (a, b) => isGreeting(a) && isGreeting(b)
)); // true
```

In the above example, we use the `isGreeting` function to compare the `greeting` property between two objects. The first comparison returns `false` because the objects are not equal in terms of both keys and values. The second one returns `true` because both values are valid greetings (`hello` and `hi`).

### **3. Key Points to Consider**
- **One-sided comparison** only ensures that all keys from the source object are present in the target object and have equal values. It does not check if the target object has extra properties.
- **Two-sided comparison** ensures both objects have exactly the same properties and values.
- You can implement **custom comparison logic** by passing a function to both one-sided and two-sided comparison functions. This can be useful when you want to handle non-standard data types (like regular expressions, dates, or custom objects) or apply custom equality rules.

---

### **4. Performance Considerations**
- **Efficiency**: Both one-sided and two-sided comparisons require iterating over the object keys, but **two-sided comparison** involves more checks since it has to check every key in both objects.
- **Custom functions**: If you're using custom functions for comparison (e.g., checking regular expressions), keep in mind that this could introduce overhead, especially with large objects.

---

### **5. Conclusion**
In JavaScript, comparing objects for equality requires a careful approach due to the way objects are stored and referenced in memory. Using the provided methods, you can easily compare objects either in a **one-sided** or **two-sided** fashion, with support for **custom value comparisons**. This allows you to handle more complex data structures efficiently, while also providing the flexibility to define custom comparison rules as needed.
