You're correct in your understanding of `Object.seal` and `Object.freeze`. These are two different methods in JavaScript for managing object immutability, and they each have different effects on the object they are applied to.

### **Object.seal()**
`Object.seal()` allows you to **modify existing properties** (if they are writable) but **prevents the addition of new properties** and **deletion of existing properties**. It marks all existing properties as **non-configurable**, which means their configuration cannot be changed (like making them writable or configurable), but their values can still be modified if they are writable.

#### Key characteristics of `Object.seal()`:
1. **Can modify existing property values** if the property is writable.
2. **Cannot add new properties** to the object.
3. **Cannot delete properties** from the object.
4. **Existing properties become non-configurable**, but their values remain mutable if they are writable.
   
Here's an example:

```javascript
const obj = {
  prop: 42
};

Object.seal(obj); // Seal the object

obj.prop = 33; // Modify the value of the existing property
console.log(obj.prop); // 33

delete obj.prop; // Try to delete the property (not allowed when sealed)
console.log(obj.prop); // 33
```

In this case, `obj.prop` was successfully updated, but you can't delete it after the object is sealed.

### **Object.freeze()**
`Object.freeze()` makes an object **immutable** by not allowing the **modification** of existing properties, **addition of new properties**, or **deletion of properties**. It marks the properties as **non-writable** and **non-configurable**.

#### Key characteristics of `Object.freeze()`:
1. **Cannot modify existing property values** â€” they are frozen.
2. **Cannot add new properties** to the object.
3. **Cannot delete properties** from the object.
4. **Makes all properties non-writable** and **non-configurable**.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const obj = {
  prop: 42
};

Object.freeze(obj); // Freeze the object

obj.prop = 33; // Try to modify the value of the existing property (not allowed)
console.log(obj.prop); // 42

delete obj.prop; // Try to delete the property (not allowed when frozen)
console.log(obj.prop); // 42
```

In this case, `obj.prop` cannot be changed or deleted, and the object is now completely frozen.

### **Difference Between `Object.seal()` and `Object.freeze()`**

| **Behavior**                 | **Object.seal()**                                   | **Object.freeze()**                                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add new properties**        | Not allowed                                        | Not allowed                                           |
| **Delete properties**         | Not allowed                                        | Not allowed                                           |
| **Modify property values**    | Allowed if the property is writable                | Not allowed                                           |
| **Make properties non-writable** | No (only makes them non-configurable)              | Yes, makes them non-writable and non-configurable    |
| **Make properties non-configurable** | Yes (properties can't be redefined or removed)    | Yes (properties can't be redefined or removed)       |

### Summary:

- **`Object.seal()`**: Seals the object so no new properties can be added, and no existing properties can be deleted. Existing properties can still be modified if they are writable. It only makes properties **non-configurable**.
  
- **`Object.freeze()`**: Freezes the object so no new properties can be added, and no existing properties can be modified or deleted. It makes all properties **non-writable** and **non-configurable**.

### Example Showing Both in Action

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

Object.seal(obj);
obj.name = "Jane"; // Allowed
obj.address = "USA"; // Not allowed
delete obj.age; // Not allowed
console.log(obj); // { name: "Jane", age: 30 }

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.name = "Mike"; // Not allowed
console.log(obj); // { name: "Jane", age: 30 }
```

In this example, after sealing the object:
- You can modify `obj.name` to "Jane".
- You can't add `obj.address` or delete `obj.age`.

After freezing the object:
- You can't modify `obj.name` to "Mike", and no changes can be made.

### **Deep Freezing/Sealing**

If you need to deeply freeze or seal all nested objects, you'd need to write a custom function that iterates over all properties and applies `Object.freeze` or `Object.seal` recursively. 

For instance:

```javascript
function deepSeal(obj) {
  Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach((prop) => {
    const value = obj[prop];
    if (value && typeof value === "object") {
      deepSeal(value); // Recursively seal nested objects
    }
  });
  return Object.seal(obj); // Seal the current object
}

const nestedObj = {
  name: "John",
  nested: {
    age: 30,
    address: {
      city: "New York"
    }
  }
};

deepSeal(nestedObj);
nestedObj.nested.age = 31; // Allowed (can modify existing properties)
nestedObj.nested.newProp = "Hello"; // Not allowed
nestedObj.nested.address.city = "Los Angeles"; // Allowed
delete nestedObj.nested.address.city; // Not allowed

console.log(nestedObj);
```

This custom `deepSeal` function ensures that all nested objects are also sealed. Similarly, you could use `Object.freeze()` in the same way to achieve deep freezing.

---

### Conclusion:
- **`Object.seal()`**: Prevents adding new properties or deleting existing ones, but allows modifying the values of writable properties.
- **`Object.freeze()`**: Prevents adding new properties, deleting existing ones, and modifying the values of existing properties. It makes the object fully immutable.

Which one to use depends on whether you want to allow modifications to the values of properties or not.
