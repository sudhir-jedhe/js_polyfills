If you'd like to preserve the original object and not modify it directly while removing the specified keys, you can create a deep copy of the object first. This way, any modifications are made on the copy, leaving the original object unchanged.

Here's an updated version of your `removeKeys` function that makes a deep copy of the object before performing the key removal. This ensures that the original object remains unchanged:

### Updated `removeKeys` Function (with Deep Copy):

```javascript
function deepCopy(obj) {
  if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) {
    return obj; // return primitive value as is
  }

  // Create a new object or array based on the type of obj
  const copy = Array.isArray(obj) ? [] : {};

  // Recurse for each key of the object or array
  for (const key in obj) {
    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      copy[key] = deepCopy(obj[key]);
    }
  }

  return copy;
}

function removeKeys(obj, keys) {
  // Make a deep copy to ensure the original object remains unmodified
  const newObj = deepCopy(obj);

  // Recursively iterate over the new object
  function recurse(obj) {
    if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
      // If it's an array, iterate over its elements and apply removeKeys recursively
      obj.forEach((item) => recurse(item));
    } else if (typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null) {
      // If it's an object, iterate over its keys
      Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {
        if (keys.includes(key)) {
          delete obj[key]; // Delete the key if it matches the keys array
        } else {
          recurse(obj[key]); // Recursively call removeKeys for nested objects or arrays
        }
      });
    }
  }

  recurse(newObj); // Start recursion on the copied object
  return newObj; // Return the modified copy
}

// Example usage:
const obj = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main Street",
    city: "San Francisco",
    state: "CA",
  },
  hobbies: ["coding", "reading", "hiking"],
};

const keysToRemove = ["age", "hobbies"];

const modifiedObj = removeKeys(obj, keysToRemove);

console.log(modifiedObj);
// Output: { name: "John Doe", address: { street: "123 Main Street", city: "San Francisco", state: "CA" } }

console.log(obj);
// Original object is unchanged:
// { name: "John Doe", age: 30, address: { street: "123 Main Street", city: "San Francisco", state: "CA" }, hobbies: ["coding", "reading", "hiking"] }
```

### Key Points:

1. **Deep Copy:** 
   The `deepCopy` function creates a deep copy of the input object. This way, the original object remains unchanged, and all modifications (like deleting keys) are done on the copy.

2. **Recursive Removal:** 
   The `removeKeys` function recursively traverses the object, checking each key and removing it if it matches any of the keys specified in the `keys` array. It handles nested objects and arrays.

3. **Preserving Original Object:**
   The original `obj` is preserved as it is. All modifications are done to the deep copy (`newObj`), which is returned after the specified keys are removed.

### Example with Nested Objects:

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  address: {
    street: "456 Elm St",
    city: "Los Angeles",
    state: "CA",
  },
  hobbies: [
    { type: "sport", name: "basketball" },
    { type: "reading", name: "novels" },
  ],
};

const keysToRemove = ["age", "name"];

const modifiedObj = removeKeys(obj, keysToRemove);

console.log(modifiedObj);
// Output:
// {
//   address: { street: "456 Elm St", city: "Los Angeles", state: "CA" },
//   hobbies: [ { type: "sport" }, { type: "reading" } ]
// }

console.log(obj);
// Output: Original object remains unchanged:
// {
//   name: "Alice",
//   age: 25,
//   address: { street: "456 Elm St", city: "Los Angeles", state: "CA" },
//   hobbies: [ { type: "sport", name: "basketball" }, { type: "reading", name: "novels" } ]
// }
```

### Explanation:

- **Deep Copy Function:**  
   The `deepCopy` function ensures that nested objects and arrays are also copied recursively. This prevents any reference to the original object from being shared with the copy.
  
- **No Direct Modification of Original Object:**  
   By operating on a deep copy (`newObj`), the original object (`obj`) remains untouched and unchanged, which is crucial when you need immutability in your data.

- **Removing Keys from Nested Objects/Arrays:**  
   The recursion ensures that if a nested object or array contains the specified keys, those are removed as well.

### Conclusion:

This version of the `removeKeys` function ensures that the original object remains intact while performing the removal of specified keys on a new deep copy. This approach is useful when you want to maintain immutability or preserve the original data structure.
