// 2. **Object constructor:**

//    The simplest way to create an empty object is using the `Object` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

var object = new Object();

//   The `Object()` is a built-in constructor function so "new" keyword is not required. The above code snippet can be re-written as:

var object = Object();
