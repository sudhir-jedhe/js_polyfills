There are some important things to understand about how JavaScript handles objects and sorting of keys. Let's break down the examples and clarify the behavior:

### Example 1: Sorting Object Keys Alphabetically in Ascending Order

```javascript
const obj = {
  'e': 1,
  'c': 2,
  'b': 3,
  'd': 4,
  'a': 5
};

const objKeys = Object.keys(obj);

// Sort keys alphabetically in ascending order
const sortedKeys = objKeys.sort((a, b) => a > b);

console.log(sortedKeys);
// Output: ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
```

- Here, `Object.keys(obj)` returns an array of keys in the object: `["e", "c", "b", "d", "a"]`.
- When you sort the keys using `.sort((a, b) => a > b)`, JavaScript compares the keys lexicographically (alphabetically).
- The `sort` method sorts the keys in **ascending order** by default when you do this comparison. So the result is `["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]`.

### Example 2: Sorting Object Keys Alphabetically in Descending Order

```javascript
const obj = {
  'e': 1,
  'c': 2,
  'b': 3,
  'd': 4,
  'a': 5
};

const objKeys = Object.keys(obj);

// Sort keys alphabetically in descending order
const sortedKeys = objKeys.sort((a, b) => b > a);

console.log(sortedKeys);
// Output: ["e", "d", "c", "b", "a"]
```

- The `sort` function is now sorting the keys in **descending order**. Since `b > a` in the comparison function, the keys are ordered from `["e", "d", "c", "b", "a"]`.

### Example 3: Sorting Object Keys with Numeric Values

```javascript
const obj = {
  2: 'a',
  4: 'b',
  1: 'c',
  3: 'd'
};

console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// Output: ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
```

- **Important Detail**: JavaScript objects with numeric keys (`1`, `2`, etc.) **automatically convert the keys to strings**. So even though we assign keys like `2`, `4`, `1`, and `3`, they are treated as `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`, and `"4"`.
- When you call `Object.keys(obj)`, the result is `["1", "2", "3", "4"]`.
- JavaScript **automatically sorts the keys** in ascending order when the keys are numeric-like strings. This is because object keys are internally stored in the following order:
  - Integer keys are sorted in ascending order (as they are treated like array indices).
  - Non-integer string keys are stored in insertion order.

### Example 4: Object with Numeric Keys

```javascript
const obj = {
  2: 'a',
  4: 'b',
  1: 'c',
  3: 'd'
};

console.log(obj);
/*
Output:
{
  "1": "c",
  "2": "a",
  "3": "d",
  "4": "b"
}
*/
```

- When logging `obj`, JavaScript automatically reorders the keys numerically, so you see:
  - The keys `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` appear in ascending order (as explained in Example 3).
  - The values corresponding to these keys are displayed in the order according to their numeric keys: `"c"`, `"a"`, `"d"`, and `"b"`.
  
### Summary

- **Sorting Object Keys**: When using `Object.keys()` followed by `sort()`, the keys will be sorted as strings (lexicographically). For numeric keys, JavaScript automatically sorts them in ascending order when the object is created.
- **Numeric Keys**: When an object has numeric keys, JavaScript treats them as array indices and sorts them numerically in ascending order.
- **String Keys**: If the object has non-numeric string keys, they are sorted lexicographically.

### Key Differences in Key Sorting

- When you use `Object.keys()` on an object, numeric keys will be sorted in ascending order by default.
- For string keys, JavaScript relies on lexicographic order unless you define your own custom sorting function (using `sort()`).
  
So, if you have an object with a mix of numeric and string keys, the numeric keys will always be sorted first, followed by the string keys in the order they were added.
