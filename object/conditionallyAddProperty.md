### Explanation of the Code:

The provided code demonstrates how to **conditionally add a property** to an object using **the spread operator (`...`)** in combination with a **conditional expression**.

#### Breakdown:

1. **Define a Flag (`includeSalary`)**:
   ```javascript
   const includeSalary = true;
   ```
   This boolean flag (`includeSalary`) determines whether or not the `salary` property should be added to the `employee` object. If `includeSalary` is `true`, the `salary` will be included; otherwise, it will not.

2. **Create the `employee` Object**:
   ```javascript
   const employee = {
     id: 1,
     name: "Sudhir",
     ...(includeSalary && { salary: 5000 }),
   };
   ```
   Here's what's happening inside the object:
   - The `employee` object is initialized with two properties: `id` and `name`.
   - The **spread operator (`...`)** is used to conditionally add the `salary` property:
     - `includeSalary && { salary: 5000 }`: If `includeSalary` is `true`, this expression evaluates to `{ salary: 5000 }`.
     - If `includeSalary` is `false`, the expression evaluates to `false`, and **no property** is added to the object.

3. **Check if `salary` Exists**:
   ```javascript
   const isSalaryExist = "salary" in employee;
   console.log(isSalaryExist);
   ```
   The expression `"salary" in employee` checks if the `salary` property exists in the `employee` object. It returns `true` if the property is present, and `false` otherwise.

### Result:

- **When `includeSalary = true`**, the object will include the `salary` property, and `"salary" in employee` will return `true`.
- **When `includeSalary = false`**, the object will **not** include the `salary` property, and `"salary" in employee` will return `false`.

### Example Output:

#### Case 1: When `includeSalary = true`

```javascript
const includeSalary = true;

const employee = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Sudhir",
  ...(includeSalary && { salary: 5000 }),
};

console.log(employee);
// Output: { id: 1, name: 'Sudhir', salary: 5000 }

const isSalaryExist = "salary" in employee;
console.log(isSalaryExist);
// Output: true
```

#### Case 2: When `includeSalary = false`

```javascript
const includeSalary = false;

const employee = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Sudhir",
  ...(includeSalary && { salary: 5000 }),
};

console.log(employee);
// Output: { id: 1, name: 'Sudhir' }

const isSalaryExist = "salary" in employee;
console.log(isSalaryExist);
// Output: false
```

### Key Points:
- The **conditional property inclusion** is achieved using the **short-circuiting behavior of `&&`** with the spread operator. If `includeSalary` is `true`, the property `salary` gets added; if it's `false`, no property is added.
- This technique is concise and helps conditionally add properties to objects without needing an `if` statement or manual property assignment.
