The function you've written, `mergeObjects`, merges two JavaScript objects by iterating through both objects and adding properties from `obj1` and `obj2` to a new object, `mergedObj`. If a property exists in both `obj1` and `obj2`, the property from `obj2` will overwrite the one from `obj1`. This is a shallow merge because if either object contains nested objects, those nested objects will not be deeply merged—they will simply be replaced if a conflict occurs.

Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

### **How it works:**
1. **First loop (for `obj1`)**: All properties of `obj1` are copied to `mergedObj`.
2. **Second loop (for `obj2`)**: All properties of `obj2` are copied to `mergedObj`. If a property with the same key exists from `obj1`, it will be overwritten by `obj2`'s value.

### Example usage:

```js
const obj1 = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};

const obj2 = {
  occupation: "Software Engineer",
  city: "San Francisco",
};

const mergedObj = mergeObjects(obj1, obj2);

console.log(mergedObj);
// Output:
// { name: 'Alice', age: 25, occupation: 'Software Engineer', city: 'San Francisco' }
```

### **Limitation:**
As mentioned, the merge operation is **shallow**. This means if either `obj1` or `obj2` has nested objects, those nested objects won't be merged recursively. Instead, if a nested object is present in both `obj1` and `obj2`, it will be overwritten by the object from `obj2`. Here's an example:

```js
const obj1 = {
  name: "Alice",
  details: { age: 25, city: "New York" },
};

const obj2 = {
  details: { occupation: "Software Engineer", city: "San Francisco" },
  country: "USA",
};

const mergedObj = mergeObjects(obj1, obj2);

console.log(mergedObj);
// Output:
// {
//   name: 'Alice',
//   details: { occupation: 'Software Engineer', city: 'San Francisco' },
//   country: 'USA'
// }
// The details object from obj1 is overwritten completely by the details object from obj2
```

### **Using `deepmerge` library for a deeper merge:**
If you want to perform a **deep merge** (merging nested objects recursively), you can use the popular library [**deepmerge**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge). This will ensure that nested objects are merged recursively rather than being replaced.

Here’s how to use `deepmerge`:

1. **Install deepmerge**:
   You can install it via npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install deepmerge
   ```

2. **Usage**:

```js
import deepmerge from "deepmerge";

const obj1 = {
  name: "Alice",
  details: { age: 25, city: "New York" },
};

const obj2 = {
  details: { occupation: "Software Engineer", city: "San Francisco" },
  country: "USA",
};

const mergedObj = deepmerge(obj1, obj2);

console.log(mergedObj);
// Output:
// {
//   name: 'Alice',
//   details: { age: 25, city: 'San Francisco', occupation: 'Software Engineer' },
//   country: 'USA'
// }
```

### **Explanation of deepmerge behavior:**
- In the above example, the `details` object in both `obj1` and `obj2` is **deeply merged**. The `city` field from `obj2` overwrites `obj1`, but the `age` field from `obj1` remains intact.
- The rest of the properties from both objects are merged at the top level.

### **Creating your own deep merge:**
If you don’t want to use an external library like `deepmerge`, you can implement your own **deep merge function** using recursion.

Here’s an example:

```js
function deepMerge(obj1, obj2) {
  const result = { ...obj1 };

  for (const key in obj2) {
    if (obj2.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      // If both values are objects, merge them recursively
      if (isObject(obj1[key]) && isObject(obj2[key])) {
        result[key] = deepMerge(obj1[key], obj2[key]);
      } else {
        // Otherwise, take the value from obj2
        result[key] = obj2[key];
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}

function isObject(value) {
  return value && typeof value === "object" && !Array.isArray(value);
}

// Usage
const obj1 = {
  name: "Alice",
  details: { age: 25, city: "New York" },
};

const obj2 = {
  details: { occupation: "Software Engineer", city: "San Francisco" },
  country: "USA",
};

const mergedObj = deepMerge(obj1, obj2);

console.log(mergedObj);
// Output:
// {
//   name: 'Alice',
//   details: { age: 25, city: 'San Francisco', occupation: 'Software Engineer' },
//   country: 'USA'
// }
```

### **How the deepMerge function works:**
- The function checks if both `obj1` and `obj2` have the same key and if the values for that key are both objects.
- If they are both objects, it recursively merges them.
- Otherwise, it simply assigns the value from `obj2` to the resulting object.

### **Summary:**
- Your original `mergeObjects` function works for shallow merges but does not handle nested objects recursively.
- To perform a **deep merge**, you can use a library like `deepmerge`, or implement your own recursive deep merge function.
