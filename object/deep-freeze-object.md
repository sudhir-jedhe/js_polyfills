Your code snippet outlines a great approach for working with immutability in JavaScript. You're creating an immutability helper like **Immer's `produce()`** function that allows modifications to an otherwise immutable object in a controlled manner. Let's break down how your solution works and clarify each part:

### 1. **Deep Freeze Function (`deepFreeze`)**

This function ensures that an object (and all its nested objects) is frozen, meaning that none of its properties can be changed, added, or deleted. The `deepFreeze` function is recursive and freezes every nested object within the main object.

```javascript
function deepFreeze(object) {
  // Retrieve the property names defined on object
  var propNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object);

  // Freeze properties before freezing self
  for (let name of propNames) {
    let value = object[name];

    // Recursively freeze if the property is an object
    object[name] = value && typeof value === "object" ? deepFreeze(value) : value;
  }

  return Object.freeze(object);
};
```

**Explanation:**
- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object)` gets the own properties (keys) of the object.
- It checks if a property is an object itself (`typeof value === "object"`), and if it is, it recursively calls `deepFreeze()` on that property.
- Finally, `Object.freeze()` is applied to the object itself.

This ensures that the entire object, including its nested objects, is deeply frozen.

### 2. **Deep Equal Function (`deepEqual`)**

The `deepEqual` function is used to compare two objects for deep equality. It ensures that the values at each level of the object are the same, including nested objects.

```javascript
const deepEqual = (object1, object2) => {
  const keys1 = Object.keys(object1);
  const keys2 = Object.keys(object2);
  
  if (keys1.length !== keys2.length) {
    return false;
  }

  for (const key of keys1) {
    const val1 = object1[key];
    const val2 = object2[key];
    
    const areObjects = val1 && typeof val1 === "object" && val2 && typeof val2 === "object";
    
    if(areObjects){
      if(!deepEqual(val1, val2)){
        return false;
      }
    } else if(val1 !== val2){
       return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
};
```

**Explanation:**
- The function first compares the number of keys in both objects. If they don't match, they can't be deeply equal.
- Then, for each key, it checks whether both values are objects. If they are, it calls `deepEqual` recursively to compare the nested objects. If the values are not objects, it compares them directly.

This function is key for detecting whether the original object and the clone are identical before applying updates.

### 3. **The `produce` Function**

This is the main function where the magic happens. It mimics the behavior of Immer’s `produce()` function, allowing us to "draft" an object and make changes to it without affecting the original.

```javascript
function produce(base, recipe) {
  // Clone the frozen object
  let clone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(base));
  
  // Pass the clone to the recipe function to modify it
  recipe(clone);
  
  // If the original and clone are the same, don't update the clone
  if(deepEqual(base, clone)) {
    clone = base;
  }
  
  // Deep freeze the modified object to prevent further changes
  deepFreeze(clone);
  
  return clone;
};
```

**Explanation:**
- The `produce()` function starts by creating a **deep copy** of the original object (`base`) using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(base))`. This creates a new object so that we don't mutate the original.
- The `recipe` function is passed the clone, and any changes made inside `recipe` will affect the clone.
- After the changes are applied, we use `deepEqual()` to compare the `base` and `clone`. If they are the same, it means no changes were made, so we leave the `clone` as the `base`. If changes were made, we continue.
- Finally, we `deepFreeze()` the modified object to make it immutable, just like the original.

### 4. **Example Usage:**

Here’s an example of how you can use the `produce` function to update an object while maintaining immutability.

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: {
    b: {
      c: 2
    }
  }
};

// Object is frozen and cannot be updated directly
deepFreeze(obj);

// Use `produce` to update the object in an immutable way
const newState = produce(obj, draft => {
  draft.a.b.c = 3;
  draft.a.b.d = 4;
});

console.log(newState);
/*
{
  "a": {
    "b": {
      "c": 3,
      "d": 4
    }
  }
}
*/

// `newState` is also frozen and cannot be updated directly
delete newState.a.b.c;
console.log(newState);

/*
{
  "a": {
    "b": {
      "c": 3,
      "d": 4
    }
  }
}
*/
```

**Explanation:**
- `obj` is initially deeply frozen using `deepFreeze()`. This prevents any modifications to it.
- `produce()` is used to create a new object (`newState`) based on the `obj`. The `recipe` function modifies the `draft` (which is the clone), allowing us to safely update the object’s properties.
- After the changes are made, `newState` is also frozen, ensuring it remains immutable.
- Any attempts to modify `newState` directly (like using `delete`) will result in an error in strict mode, as `Object.freeze()` prevents such modifications.

### Summary of How the System Works:
- **Deep immutability:** Using `deepFreeze`, all properties and nested objects are made immutable.
- **Produce function:** Allows updates to an immutable object by cloning it, applying changes, and then returning a new, frozen version of the object.
- **Safety and Control:** The `produce` function ensures that immutability is maintained and that the original object cannot be modified directly.
- **Deep equality check:** The `deepEqual` function ensures that changes are applied only if necessary, preventing unnecessary cloning.

This approach mimics the **Immer** library’s behavior but gives you full control over the freezing process and object immutability. It ensures that you can modify objects in an immutable way while still adhering to the principles of immutability and preventing direct mutations.
