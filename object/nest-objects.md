Sure! Below is the complete code for the `nest` function, which transforms flat data into a nested structure based on a parent-child relationship. It uses the `filter` method to get the child items and the `map` method to recursively add children.

### Complete Code

```javascript
// The function to recursively nest the items
const nest = (items, id = null, link = 'parentId') =>
  items
    .filter(item => item[link] === id)  // Filter items based on the parent id
    .map(item => ({
      ...item,  // Include all item properties
      children: nest(items, item.id, link)  // Recursively nest children
    }));

// Sample data with id and parentId
const comments = [
  { id: 1, parentId: null },
  { id: 2, parentId: 1 },
  { id: 3, parentId: 1 },
  { id: 4, parentId: 2 },
  { id: 5, parentId: 4 }
];

// Calling the `nest` function to create a nested structure
const nestedComments = nest(comments);

// Displaying the result in the console
console.log(JSON.stringify(nestedComments, null, 2));

```

### Explanation:

1. **`nest` function:**
   - **`items`**: An array of items (e.g., comments).
   - **`id`**: The ID of the parent item (starting with `null` for the root level).
   - **`link`**: The key that links a child item to its parent (default is `'parentId'`).

   The function filters items where the `parentId` matches the current `id`. Then, for each of these filtered items, it recursively finds their children by calling `nest` again.

2. **The `comments` array** contains sample data with `id` and `parentId`.

3. The **`nestedComments`** is the result of calling the `nest` function on the `comments` array, which produces a hierarchical structure.

### Output:

When you run this code, the following nested structure will be logged to the console:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "parentId": null,
    "children": [
      {
        "id": 2,
        "parentId": 1,
        "children": [
          {
            "id": 4,
            "parentId": 2,
            "children": [
              {
                "id": 5,
                "parentId": 4,
                "children": []
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "parentId": 1,
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Key Points:
- The function recursively finds children for each item using the `parentId` and creates a `children` array for each parent item.
- It uses **recursion** to go deeper into the hierarchy until there are no more children for a given parent.
- The result is a deeply nested structure that reflects the relationships between the items based on their `parentId`.

### Customizing the Nesting Logic:
- You can easily customize this function by changing the `link` parameter if your parent-child relationship is stored in a different property (e.g., `supervisorId`, `categoryId`).
- You can also modify the filter logic or how children are handled based on specific criteria.
