Yes, you're absolutely correct, and your explanation highlights a very important concept in JavaScript's handling of objects and how they are passed to functions. Let's break down the concept further to ensure it's clear:

### **JavaScript's Pass-by-Value Mechanism**

JavaScript **always passes arguments by value**, but the confusion arises when dealing with objects. Here’s the key distinction:

- **Primitive values (like numbers, strings, booleans)** are passed **by value**. This means when you pass a primitive value to a function, the function works on a **copy** of that value. Modifications to this copy don't affect the original value.

- **Objects** (and arrays, functions, etc.) are **reference types**, but when passed to a function, they are passed **by value** as well — but the value that’s being passed is the **reference to the object**, not the object itself.

#### **Key Insight:**
When you pass an object to a function, you're passing a **reference to that object**, but the reference itself is passed **by value**. This means the function receives a copy of the reference, and both the original reference (in the calling context) and the copy (in the function) point to the same object in memory.

### **Effect on the Original Object**

As you mentioned in your example, **changes made to the object inside the function will affect the original object** because both the original reference and the passed reference point to the same object in memory. However, **reassigning the reference inside the function will not affect the original reference** outside the function.

Let’s break your example down step by step:

### **Example Breakdown**

```javascript
let myObj = { a: 1 };

const myFunc = (obj) => {
  obj.a++;  // This modifies the original object
  return obj;  // Returns the same reference, not a new object
}

let otherObj = myFunc(myObj);

// After calling myFunc:
myObj;                // { a: 2 }
otherObj;             // { a: 2 }
myObj === otherObj;   // true (both point to the same object)
```

#### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Object Declaration:**
   - `myObj = { a: 1 }` creates an object with a property `a` set to `1`.
   - `myObj` holds a reference to this object in memory.

2. **Passing `myObj` to `myFunc`:**
   - When you call `myFunc(myObj)`, the reference to the object `{ a: 1 }` is passed to the function, but it's passed **by value**.
   - Inside the function, `obj` is a copy of the reference that points to the same object in memory.
   
3. **Modifying the Object Inside the Function:**
   - Inside the function, `obj.a++` increments the `a` property of the object, so the object is now `{ a: 2 }`.
   - Since `obj` is just a reference to the same object as `myObj`, this modification affects both `myObj` and `obj` in the outer scope because both refer to the same object in memory.

4. **Returning `obj`:**
   - `myFunc` returns `obj`, which is the same reference pointing to the object `{ a: 2 }`.
   - You assign this returned reference to `otherObj`.
   
5. **Final Check:**
   - After the function call, both `myObj` and `otherObj` refer to the same object, `{ a: 2 }`, which is confirmed by `myObj === otherObj` being `true`.

---

Now, let's see what happens when we reassign `myObj`:

```javascript
myObj = { a: 4, b: 0 };

myObj;                // { a: 4, b: 0 }
otherObj;             // { a: 2 }
myObj === otherObj;   // false (they point to different objects)
```

#### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Reassigning `myObj`:**
   - When you reassign `myObj` to `{ a: 4, b: 0 }`, you are changing the reference that `myObj` holds.
   - Now, `myObj` points to a completely new object `{ a: 4, b: 0 }`.

2. **Effect on `otherObj`:**
   - The reference in `otherObj` still points to the original object `{ a: 2 }`. Reassigning `myObj` does **not** change `otherObj` because `otherObj` was never affected by the reassignment of `myObj`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - Now, `myObj === otherObj` is `false` because `myObj` and `otherObj` point to different objects.

---

### **Why Is This Not Pass-by-Reference?**

This behavior demonstrates that **JavaScript is still pass-by-value** because the value of the variable being passed to the function (the reference) is copied, not the original reference itself. The copy of the reference is used within the function, and even though that reference points to the same object in memory, reassigning it inside the function does **not** affect the original reference.

If JavaScript were truly pass-by-reference, reassigning `myObj` inside the function would also affect `myObj` in the outer scope. But as we've seen, it doesn't.

### **Visualizing It:**

Let’s visualize the process to clarify:

1. **Before Calling `myFunc`:**
   ```
   myObj ---> { a: 1 }
   ```

2. **Inside `myFunc`:**
   ```
   obj ---> { a: 1 }  // 'obj' is a copy of the reference passed to the function
   obj.a++             // 'obj' now points to { a: 2 }
   ```

3. **After Calling `myFunc`:**
   ```
   myObj ---> { a: 2 }
   otherObj ---> { a: 2 }  // 'otherObj' points to the same object
   ```

4. **Reassigning `myObj`:**
   ```
   myObj ---> { a: 4, b: 0 }  // 'myObj' now points to a new object
   otherObj ---> { a: 2 }      // 'otherObj' still points to the original object
   ```

### **Conclusion**

In JavaScript:

- **Primitives** are passed by value, meaning the function gets a copy of the value.
- **Objects** are passed by value, but that value is a **reference** to the object. This can cause some confusion, but it's important to note that while both the original variable and the argument in the function refer to the same object, they are still distinct variables holding a reference to that object.
- Reassigning the reference inside the function does **not** change the reference outside the function.

This behavior is crucial for understanding JavaScript's object handling, and helps explain why objects are often said to be "passed by reference," despite the underlying mechanics being pass-by-value.
