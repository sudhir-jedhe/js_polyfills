To validate object keys against an array or another object, the methods you've provided are great starting points. Let's break down the approach and explain the different validations with examples.

### 1. **Validate against an array of keys**
You can use various methods to compare the keys of an object to a predefined array of keys. Depending on your needs, you may need to:
- Ensure all keys of the object are present in the array.
- Ensure all keys in the array are present in the object.
- Check if the object keys exactly match the array.

### **1.1. Validate if all keys in the object are present in the array**
This will check if **all the keys of the object** are in the provided keys array.

```javascript
const keysAreValid = (obj, keys) =>
  Object.keys(obj).every(key => keys.includes(key));

// Example usage:
const obj = { id: 1, name: 'apple', price: 1.2 };
const keys = ['id', 'name', 'price'];

console.log(keysAreValid(obj, keys)); // true
console.log(keysAreValid(obj, [...keys, 'quantity'])); // true
```

**Explanation:**
- **`Object.keys(obj)`**: Get the keys of the object.
- **`.every()`**: Iterate through the object's keys and check if every key is present in the provided `keys` array using `.includes()`.

### **1.2. Validate if all keys in the array are present in the object**
This will check if **all the keys in the array** are present in the object.

```javascript
const allKeysArePresent = (obj, keys) => {
  const objKeys = Object.keys(obj);
  return keys.every(key => objKeys.includes(key));
};

// Example usage:
console.log(allKeysArePresent(obj, keys)); // true
console.log(allKeysArePresent(obj, [...keys, 'quantity'])); // false
```

**Explanation:**
- **`keys.every()`**: Iterate through the array `keys` and check if every key is present in the object using `objKeys.includes(key)`.

### **1.3. Validate if keys exactly match the specified array**
This checks that the object has the exact same keys as the array, with no extra or missing keys.

```javascript
const keysMatch = (obj, keys) =>
  keysAreValid(obj, keys) && allKeysArePresent(obj, keys);

// Example usage:
console.log(keysMatch(obj, keys)); // true
console.log(keysMatch(obj, [...keys, 'quantity'])); // false
```

**Explanation:**
- **`keysAreValid`** ensures the object only contains keys from the `keys` array.
- **`allKeysArePresent`** ensures the object contains all keys from the `keys` array, without any extra keys.

### 2. **Validate against another object**
If you want to check if one object has the same keys as another object, you can compare the keys directly.

### **2.1. Validate if all keys in the target object are present in the source object**
This checks if the target object contains **only the keys present in the source object**.

```javascript
const objectKeysAreValid = (obj, source) =>
  keysAreValid(obj, Object.keys(source));

// Example usage:
const target = { id: 1, name: 'apple', price: 1.2 };
const source = { id: 1, name: 'apple', price: 1.2 };

console.log(objectKeysAreValid(target, source)); // true
console.log(objectKeysAreValid(target, { ...source, quantity: 10 })); // true
```

**Explanation:**
- **`Object.keys(source)`**: Get the keys from the source object.
- **`keysAreValid()`**: Check if all the keys from the target object are present in the source object.

### **2.2. Validate if all keys in the source object are present in the target object**
This checks if the **source object's keys** are present in the target object.

```javascript
const objectKeysArePresent = (obj, source) =>
  allKeysArePresent(obj, Object.keys(source));

// Example usage:
console.log(objectKeysArePresent(target, source)); // true
console.log(objectKeysArePresent(target, { ...source, quantity: 10 })); // false
```

**Explanation:**
- **`Object.keys(source)`**: Get the keys from the source object.
- **`allKeysArePresent()`**: Check if all the keys from the source object are present in the target object.

### **2.3. Validate if the keys of both objects exactly match**
This checks if the **keys of the target object match exactly** the keys of the source object.

```javascript
const objectKeysMatch = (obj, source) =>
  keysMatch(obj, Object.keys(source));

// Example usage:
console.log(objectKeysMatch(target, source)); // true
console.log(objectKeysMatch(target, { ...source, quantity: 10 })); // false
```

**Explanation:**
- **`keysMatch()`**: Ensures both objects have the exact same keys.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

These methods only check the presence of keys. If you need to check whether the objects are truly identical, including both **keys and values**, you can use a deep comparison for both the keys and values. For example, here's how you could implement a deep comparison for keys and values:

```javascript
const deepEqual = (obj1, obj2) => {
  if (obj1 === obj2) return true; // Same reference or identical primitive values
  if (typeof obj1 !== "object" || typeof obj2 !== "object" || obj1 === null || obj2 === null)
    return false;
  
  const keys1 = Object.keys(obj1);
  const keys2 = Object.keys(obj2);
  
  if (keys1.length !== keys2.length) return false;
  
  for (let key of keys1) {
    if (!keys2.includes(key) || !deepEqual(obj1[key], obj2[key])) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
};

const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
console.log(deepEqual(obj1, obj2)); // true
```

This `deepEqual` function compares both keys and values recursively, ensuring the two objects are truly identical.

### **Summary**

- **`keysAreValid`** checks if all keys in the object are present in the provided array.
- **`allKeysArePresent`** checks if all keys in the array are present in the object.
- **`keysMatch`** ensures that the object's keys exactly match the array.
- **`objectKeysAreValid`**, **`objectKeysArePresent`**, and **`objectKeysMatch`** check keys between two objects.
  
By combining these functions, you can handle various key validation scenarios when working with JavaScript objects.
