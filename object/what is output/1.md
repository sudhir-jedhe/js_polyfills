### 1. Error when Accessing Undefined Property

```js
const obj = {};
console.log(obj.someprop.x);
```

This code will throw an error because you're attempting to access `x` on a property `someprop` which doesn't exist on the object `obj`. Let's break it down:

- `obj.someprop` will return `undefined` because `someprop` does not exist on the object `obj`. In JavaScript, if you try to access a property that doesnâ€™t exist, the result is `undefined`.
- When you attempt to access `obj.someprop.x`, you're essentially trying to access `x` on `undefined`, which leads to the error:
  
  ```
  TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined
  ```

**Why?**

In JavaScript, properties of an object that are not explicitly defined have a default value of `undefined`. `undefined` itself is a primitive value, and primitive values (such as `undefined`, `null`, numbers, strings) do not have properties or methods. Therefore, trying to access `x` on `undefined` results in a runtime error.

### 2. Why `b` Becomes a Global Variable

```js
function myFunc() {
  let a = b = 0;
}

myFunc();
```

When you run this code, you might observe that the variable `b` becomes a **global** variable, even though it was not explicitly declared as such within the function.

### **Reason for This:**

This happens because of **JavaScript's variable assignment behavior** and the **right-to-left associativity of the assignment operator (`=`)**. Here's a breakdown:

- The expression `let a = b = 0` has two assignments, evaluated from right to left due to the right-to-left associativity of the `=` operator.
- First, `b = 0` is evaluated. Since `b` is not declared in the current scope (no `let`, `const`, or `var`), JavaScript **implicitly creates a global variable `b`**.
- Next, the value `0` (the result of `b = 0`) is assigned to the local variable `a` because the left side of the assignment `let a = ...` is evaluated afterward.

In summary:

- `b = 0` creates a **global variable** `b`.
- The `let a = ...` assigns the value of `b = 0` (which is `0`) to the local variable `a`.

### **How to Fix the Problem:**

The problem can be avoided by declaring the variable `b` properly before assignment:

```js
function myFunc() {
  let a, b;  // Declare both `a` and `b` explicitly
  a = b = 0; // Now both are properly scoped
}

myFunc();
```

In this corrected version:

- `let a, b;` ensures that both `a` and `b` are local variables.
- `a = b = 0` will now correctly assign `0` to both `a` and `b` in the local scope of the function.

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**

1. **Accessing undefined properties**: When you try to access a property that doesn't exist on an object, JavaScript will return `undefined`. Trying to access a property on `undefined` results in a `TypeError`.
   
2. **Global variable creation**: When you assign a value to a variable that is not declared (i.e., no `let`, `const`, or `var`), JavaScript will automatically create a **global variable** (in the global execution context) rather than a local one. This is because the assignment (`=`) evaluates right to left, and the first part of the assignment (`b = 0`) creates a global variable `b`.

To avoid such pitfalls, always declare your variables with `let`, `const`, or `var` to ensure they are scoped correctly.
