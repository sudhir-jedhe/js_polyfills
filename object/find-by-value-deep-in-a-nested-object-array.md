The code you're using aims to search for an object that contains a specific key-value pair, even if it exists deeply nested within the object. However, there are a couple of issues in the original `findNested` function, and I'll go over them to help you get it working correctly.

### Issues in the Original Code:

1. **Incorrect recursion approach**: 
   - In the first version of the `findNested` function, `this.findNested` was used, but `this` is unnecessary (and in some cases incorrect) for recursive function calls. We just need to call `findNested` directly.
   - The second version fixes this by directly calling `findNested` within the recursion, which is correct.

2. **Indexing for objects**: 
   - The first version iterates over the object using the `i` index (`Object.keys(obj).length`), which works if you're treating the object like an array, but objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. The correct way is to use the actual keys from `Object.keys(obj)` to ensure you're working with key-value pairs correctly.

3. **Null handling**:
   - You need to ensure that `obj[k]` exists before trying to recursively search it, so checking if `obj[k]` is truthy (i.e., not `null` or `undefined`) is necessary.

### Corrected and Improved `findNested` function:

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `findNested` function:

```js
function findNested(obj, key, value) {
  // Base case: If the key exists in the object and matches the value, return the object
  if (obj[key] === value) {
    return obj;
  }

  // Iterate over the object's keys
  for (var k in obj) {
    // Only recurse if the current value is an object (and not null)
    if (obj[k] && typeof obj[k] === "object") {
      // Recurse into the nested object
      var found = findNested(obj[k], key, value);
      if (found) {
        return found; // If found, return the found object
      }
    }
  }

  // Return undefined if no matching object was found
  return undefined;
}

// Test data
var elements = [
  {
    fields: null,
    id_base: "nv_container",
    icon: "layout",
    name: "container",
    is_container: true,
    elements: [
      {
        id_base: "nested_element",
        icon: "edit",
        name: "nested_container",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    id_base: "novo_example_elementsec",
    name: "hello",
    icon: "edit",
    view: {},
  },
];

// Test cases
console.log(findNested(elements, "icon", "layout")); // Returns the object with "icon": "layout"
console.log(findNested(elements, "icon", "edit"));   // Returns the object with "icon": "edit"
console.log(findNested(elements, "foo", "bar"));     // Returns undefined (not found)
```

### Key Points:
- **Recursion**: The function recurses into an object only if that object exists and is of type `object` (ignoring `null` values).
- **Base case**: The recursion checks if the current `key` has the required `value`. If found, it returns the object immediately.
- **Iterating with `for...in`**: We use `for...in` to iterate over all the keys of the object, which gives us access to each property.
- **Edge handling**: If the key doesn't match the value at any level of nesting, the function returns `undefined`.

### Example Output:

```js
console.log(findNested(elements, "icon", "layout"));
// Output: { fields: null, id_base: "nv_container", icon: "layout", name: "container", is_container: true, elements: [...] }

console.log(findNested(elements, "icon", "edit"));
// Output: { id_base: "novo_example_elementsec", name: "hello", icon: "edit", view: {} }

console.log(findNested(elements, "foo", "bar"));
// Output: undefined
```

### Explanation:

1. **First Test**: `findNested(elements, "icon", "layout")` searches through the `elements` array and returns the first object that has the key `"icon"` with the value `"layout"`.
2. **Second Test**: `findNested(elements, "icon", "edit")` searches and returns the object with `"icon": "edit"`.
3. **Third Test**: `findNested(elements, "foo", "bar")` returns `undefined` because there's no object with the key `"foo"` having the value `"bar"`.

### Performance Considerations:

- **Time Complexity**: The function will have a time complexity of O(n) where `n` is the total number of properties in all nested objects. Since this is a depth-first search, it will explore all objects, and each property will be checked.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(d), where `d` is the depth of recursion (the depth of nesting in your object), as the call stack will grow proportionally to the depth.

This solution is efficient for most use cases where you're looking for a deeply nested property in JavaScript.
