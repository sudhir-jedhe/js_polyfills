To implement the `ATM` class as described, we need to follow the steps laid out in the problem:

### Requirements:
1. **ATM Object Initialization:** When we create an `ATM` object, it starts with no banknotes, i.e., the banknote counts are initialized to zero for all denominations.
2. **Deposit:** The `deposit` function allows us to deposit a certain number of banknotes in each denomination, updating the ATM’s banknote counts.
3. **Withdraw:** The `withdraw` function will attempt to withdraw the requested amount using the banknotes available in the ATM. If it's not possible to exactly match the requested amount using available banknotes, it should return `[-1]`.

### Approach:
- The banknotes are represented by the array `cnt` for each denomination `[20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`.
- We will prioritize using larger denominations first when withdrawing (i.e., the ATM will first try to use 500 dollar bills, then 200, 100, 50, and finally 20).
- The `withdraw` function will first calculate how many banknotes of each denomination are required to fulfill the withdrawal amount, and then check if the ATM has enough banknotes of each denomination to fulfill the request.
- If the exact amount cannot be withdrawn, return `[-1]`, otherwise return an array with the count of each banknote used.

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

```typescript
class ATM {
    private cnt: number[];
    private d: number[];

    constructor() {
        // Initialize banknote counts for [20, 50, 100, 200, 500] denominations
        this.cnt = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
        // Denominations: [20, 50, 100, 200, 500]
        this.d = [20, 50, 100, 200, 500];
    }

    // Deposit method to add new banknotes to the ATM
    deposit(banknotesCount: number[]): void {
        for (let i = 0; i < banknotesCount.length; i++) {
            this.cnt[i] += banknotesCount[i]; // Add the deposited count to the current count
        }
    }

    // Withdraw method to attempt to withdraw a specific amount
    withdraw(amount: number): number[] {
        let ans = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; // Array to store the number of banknotes for each denomination
        
        // Try to withdraw from the largest denomination first (500 -> 200 -> 100 -> 50 -> 20)
        for (let i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Calculate the maximum number of banknotes of denomination d[i] we can use
            ans[i] = Math.min(Math.floor(amount / this.d[i]), this.cnt[i]);
            // Reduce the amount by the value of the banknotes we're using
            amount -= ans[i] * this.d[i];
        }

        // If the remaining amount is not zero, it means the withdrawal cannot be completed
        if (amount > 0) {
            return [-1];
        }

        // Deduct the banknotes from the ATM's banknote count
        for (let i = 0; i < ans.length; i++) {
            this.cnt[i] -= ans[i];
        }

        // Return the result array showing how many of each denomination were used
        return ans;
    }
}

/**
 * Example usage:
 * Initialize ATM
 * const atm = new ATM();
 * atm.deposit([0, 0, 1, 2, 1]);
 * console.log(atm.withdraw(600)); // Expected output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
 * atm.deposit([0, 1, 0, 1, 1]);
 * console.log(atm.withdraw(600)); // Expected output: [-1]
 * console.log(atm.withdraw(550)); // Expected output: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
 */
```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Constructor (`constructor`):**
   - Initializes two arrays:
     - `cnt`: A list of banknote counts for each denomination (`[20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`), initially set to zero.
     - `d`: An array of the denominations sorted in descending order `[500, 200, 100, 50, 20]`.

2. **Deposit Method (`deposit`):**
   - Takes an array `banknotesCount` as input, which contains the count of banknotes for each denomination in the same order as in the `d` array.
   - For each denomination, it adds the number of banknotes deposited to the corresponding index in the `cnt` array.

3. **Withdraw Method (`withdraw`):**
   - Takes the `amount` to withdraw.
   - Starts by creating an `ans` array initialized to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` to track how many banknotes of each denomination are used.
   - Then, for each denomination (starting from the largest), it calculates how many banknotes can be used to reduce the `amount`. It uses `Math.floor(amount / denomination)` to determine how many banknotes of a given denomination are required, and ensures that it doesn't use more banknotes than available in the ATM.
   - If after processing all denominations the amount is still greater than 0, it returns `[-1]` (indicating the withdrawal is not possible).
   - If successful, it deducts the banknotes from the `cnt` array and returns an array of the banknotes used for each denomination.

### Example Test Case:

1. **Input:**
   ```javascript
   ["ATM", "deposit", "withdraw", "deposit", "withdraw", "withdraw"]
   [[], [[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]], [600], [[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]], [600], [550]]
   ```

2. **Explanation:**
   - **ATM Creation:** A new ATM is initialized with empty banknotes (`cnt = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`).
   - **Deposit:** We deposit `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]` — this means 1 100-dollar bill, 2 200-dollar bills, and 1 500-dollar bill are deposited.
     - `cnt` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.
   - **Withdraw (600):** The ATM attempts to withdraw 600. It will use 1 100-dollar bill and 1 500-dollar bill.
     - `cnt` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0]` and it returns `[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
   - **Deposit Again:** We deposit `[0, 1, 0, 1, 1]` — 1 50-dollar bill, 1 200-dollar bill, and 1 500-dollar bill.
     - `cnt` becomes `[0, 1, 0, 3, 1]`.
   - **Withdraw (600):** The ATM attempts to withdraw 600, but after using the 500-dollar bill, it cannot fulfill the remaining 100 with the available 200-dollar bills. Thus, the withdrawal fails and it returns `[-1]`.
   - **Withdraw (550):** The ATM successfully withdraws 550 using 1 50-dollar bill and 1 500-dollar bill. It returns `[0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`.

### Expected Output:
```javascript
[null, null, [0, 0, 1, 0, 1], null, [-1], [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]]
```

### Conclusion:
This implementation efficiently handles deposits and withdrawals while ensuring that the ATM follows the rules for prioritizing larger banknotes and returning the appropriate response when a withdrawal cannot be completed.
