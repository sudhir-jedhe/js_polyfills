Your `isValidMountainArray` function is almost correct, but there are a few points that can be slightly enhanced for clarity and robustness. Specifically:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The condition `i === 0 || i === n - 1` is correct to ensure the peak is not at the start or end, but you also need to ensure that the array is strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing, meaning no equal adjacent elements.

2. **Validation for "Strictly Increasing" and "Strictly Decreasing"**: The function should ensure that there is at least one increasing step and one decreasing step, so the array is strictly increasing before the peak and strictly decreasing after the peak.

3. **Ensure `arr[i] !== arr[i+1]` for both slopes**: Make sure adjacent elements during the increasing and decreasing phases are different.

### Updated `isValidMountainArray` Function:

```javascript
// isValidMountainArray.js
export function isValidMountainArray(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;
  
  // Edge case: If array has fewer than 3 elements, it can't be a mountain
  if (n < 3) return false;

  let i = 0;

  // Check strictly increasing slope
  while (i + 1 < n && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]) {
    i++;
  }

  // Peak can't be at the beginning or end, and there should be at least one step increasing
  if (i === 0 || i === n - 1) {
    return false;
  }

  // Check strictly decreasing slope
  while (i + 1 < n && arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
    i++;
  }

  // Check if we reached the end of the array
  return i === n - 1;
}
```

### Key Enhancements:
1. **Length Check**: If the array has fewer than 3 elements, it can't be a valid mountain array, as there must be at least one element on each side of the peak.
2. **Strict Increase/Decrease**: The slopes must be strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing. This is validated by checking that adjacent elements are not equal.
3. **Return After Complete Iteration**: The function returns `true` only if we've traversed the entire array, ensuring both slopes are correctly followed.

### Example Tests:

```javascript
// main.js
import { isValidMountainArray } from "./isValidMountainArray.js";

const arr1 = [2, 1]; // Not a valid mountain array
const arr2 = [3, 5, 5]; // Not a valid mountain array (equal elements)
const arr3 = [0, 3, 2, 1]; // Valid mountain array
const arr4 = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4]; // Not a valid mountain array (ascending again after decreasing)
const arr5 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; // Not a valid mountain array (no decreasing part)

console.log(isValidMountainArray(arr1)); // Output: false
console.log(isValidMountainArray(arr2)); // Output: false
console.log(isValidMountainArray(arr3)); // Output: true
console.log(isValidMountainArray(arr4)); // Output: false
console.log(isValidMountainArray(arr5)); // Output: false
```

### Explanation of Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1 (`arr1 = [2, 1]`)**: The array has fewer than 3 elements, so it cannot form a mountain, and the output is `false`.
   
2. **Test Case 2 (`arr2 = [3, 5, 5]`)**: The array has adjacent equal values (`5` and `5`), which means there is no strictly increasing or strictly decreasing slope, so the output is `false`.

3. **Test Case 3 (`arr3 = [0, 3, 2, 1]`)**: The array starts by strictly increasing (`0 -> 3`) and then strictly decreasing (`3 -> 2 -> 1`), forming a valid mountain, so the output is `true`.

4. **Test Case 4 (`arr4 = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4]`)**: This array increases and decreases correctly up to `1`, but after reaching `1`, the array increases again (`1 -> 4`), breaking the mountain structure. Therefore, the output is `false`.

5. **Test Case 5 (`arr5 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`)**: This array increases but never decreases, so it's not a valid mountain. The output is `false`.

### Summary:

This version of `isValidMountainArray` ensures the array strictly increases to a peak and then strictly decreases after that peak, with no equal adjacent elements and with a peak not at the beginning or the end of the array. It also handles arrays with fewer than 3 elements early in the function.
