The code you've provided shows different ways to define and use functions in JavaScript, with examples of how to:

1. **Define basic functions**,
2. **Export and import functions using named exports**,
3. **Create a module using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)** that exports methods.

### 1. **Basic Function Definitions and Function Calls**

In the first example, you define simple functions (`sum` and `multiply`) and call them directly within the same script.

```js
function sum(a, b) { 
    return a + b; 
} 
  
function multiply(a, b) { 
    return a * b; 
}

// Function calls
console.log(sum(4, 6));  // Output: 10
console.log(multiply(4, 6));  // Output: 24
```

Here, the functions are simple and executed within the same script context. This is standard function usage, and no external module system is used.

### 2. **Named Export and Import in Modules**

In the second example, you define two functions (`sum` and `multiply`) and export them using **named exports**. This allows you to import them into other JavaScript files, providing modularity.

```js
// Defining functions in helper.js
function sum(a, b) { 
    return a + b; 
} 
  
function multiply(a, b) { 
    return a * b; 
}

// Exporting functions
export { sum, multiply };
```

Then, you can import and use these functions in another script, like `main.js`:

```js
import { sum, multiply } from './helper.js';  // Importing the functions from helper.js

// Function calls
console.log(sum(4, 6));  // Output: 10
console.log(multiply(4, 6));  // Output: 24
```

This is a modular approach to organizing code. By using `export` and `import`, you're able to keep code separated, and re-use functions across multiple files.

### 3. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) for Creating Modules**

In the third example, you use an **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** to create a module-like structure. The IIFE allows you to define functions privately inside the scope of the function and then return an object containing those functions to make them accessible outside the IIFE.

```js
// Creating a module using IIFE
const Helper = (function () { 
    // Private functions
    function sum(a, b) { 
        return a + b; 
    } 
  
    function multiply(a, b) { 
        return a * b; 
    } 
  
    // Returning the functions as part of an object
    return { 
        sum: sum, 
        multiply: multiply, 
    }; 
})(); 

// Exporting the Helper module (though it's implicitly available here)
export default Helper;  // This makes Helper available as a default export
```

In the above code:

- You define the functions `sum` and `multiply` privately within the IIFE.
- The functions are then returned in an object, making them accessible outside the IIFE.
- The object is exported as the default export of the module.

You can then import and use this module in another script:

```js
import Helper from './helper';  // Importing the IIFE module

// Calling the methods
console.log(Helper.sum(4, 6));  // Output: 10
console.log(Helper.multiply(4, 6));  // Output: 24
```

This method encapsulates the functions and prevents external access to them directly. They are only accessible via the `Helper` object.

### **Summary of Differences:**

1. **Basic Function Calls:**
   - Functions are simply defined and called within the same script.
   - No modularization or external imports/exports.

2. **Named Export and Import:**
   - Functions are defined in one file and exported using `export`.
   - They are imported into other files using `import { functionName } from 'file'`.
   - Provides modularity and reusability.

3. **IIFE Module:**
   - Functions are encapsulated within an IIFE to prevent direct access.
   - An object containing those functions is returned and can be exported as a default export.
   - This method helps in encapsulating the functions and limiting their scope to the returned object.

---

### **When to Use Each Approach:**

- **Basic Function Definitions** are suitable for small scripts where modularization is not necessary.
- **Named Exports** are perfect for larger projects where you want to separate functionality into multiple files and reuse them across different parts of your application.
- **IIFE Modules** are useful when you want to create a module that has private methods but still exposes certain methods to the outside world, making them ideal for creating well-encapsulated modules.
