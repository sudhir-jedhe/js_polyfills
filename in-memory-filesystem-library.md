The code you've written for the `FileSystem` class is working well, but there are a few aspects that can be improved to ensure better clarity, robustness, and alignment with typical file systems.

Here's the breakdown of how your `FileSystem` class works:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - You have a `root` directory, and within it, you can create subdirectories using `createDirectory()`.
   - You can navigate between directories using `changeDirectory()` and `_changeDirectoryHelper()`.
   - You can add and delete files with `addFile()` and `deleteFile()`.
   - You can also delete directories using `deleteDirectory()`.
   
2. **Structure**:
   - Each directory is represented as an object in the `directory` tree.
   - Files within a directory are stored in an array under the `files` property.

### Key Observations:
1. **File Deletion**:
   - In the `deleteFile` function, you should check if the `files` property exists before performing any operation. Otherwise, trying to filter on an undefined value will cause errors.

2. **Directory Deletion**:
   - You properly delete the directory by using `delete` to remove a directory from the current path, which is correct. This should work fine unless there’s a need to check if the directory is empty before deleting.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - You're using paths like `'root-prashant'` for navigation, which is split into components and traversed by `_changeDirectoryHelper()`. This is a good way to simulate relative path navigation.

Let’s go over your existing implementation with a few minor improvements:

- **Check if files exist before deleting** in `deleteFile`.
- **Clarify naming** for better understanding (e.g., `root` could be renamed as `rootDir` for better clarity).

### Improved Code:

```javascript
const FileSystem = function() {
    // Initialize directory structure with root as the starting directory
    this.directory = { "root": {} };
    this.currentDir = this.directory["root"];
    this.currentDirPath = "root";
    
    // Create a new directory in the current directory
    this.createDirectory = function(name) {
        this.currentDir[name] = {}; // Add the new directory to the current directory
    }
    
    // Change to the specified directory path
    this.changeDirectory = function(path) {
        this.currentDir = this._changeDirectoryHelper(path);
        this.currentDirPath = path;
    }
    
    // Helper function to traverse directories based on path
    this._changeDirectoryHelper = function(path) {
        const paths = path.split("-");
        let current = this.directory;
        for (let key of paths) {
            current = current[key];
        }
        return current;
    }
    
    // Get the current directory path
    this.getCurDirectoryPath = function() {
        return this.currentDirPath;
    }
    
    // Get the current directory object
    this.getCurDirectory = function() {
        return this.currentDir;
    }
    
    // Add a file to the current directory
    this.addFile = function(fileName) {
        if (this.currentDir.files) {
            this.currentDir.files.push(fileName);
        } else {
            this.currentDir["files"] = [fileName];
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Delete a file from the current directory
    this.deleteFile = function(fileName) {
        if (this.currentDir.files) {
            this.currentDir.files = this.currentDir.files.filter((e) => e !== fileName);
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Delete a directory from the current directory
    this.deleteDirectory = function(name) {
        delete this.currentDir[name];
    }
    
    // Get the full directory structure
    this.getRootDirectory = function() {
        return this.directory;
    }
}

// Example usage
const dir = new FileSystem();
dir.createDirectory('prashant');
dir.changeDirectory('root-prashant');
dir.addFile('index.html');
dir.addFile('app.js');
dir.changeDirectory('root');
dir.createDirectory('practice');
dir.changeDirectory('root-practice');
dir.addFile('index.html');
dir.addFile('app.js');
dir.createDirectory('build');
dir.changeDirectory('root-practice-build');
dir.addFile('a.png');
dir.addFile('b.jpg');
dir.deleteFile('a.png');
dir.changeDirectory('root');
dir.deleteDirectory('prashant');

console.log(JSON.stringify(dir.getRootDirectory(), null, 2));
```

### Key Changes:
1. **File Deletion Check**:
   - `deleteFile` now ensures that we only try to filter the `files` property if it exists (`if (this.currentDir.files)`).

2. **Formatting**:
   - Added some small improvements to the readability and flow of the code.
   - Used `JSON.stringify` with formatting to easily view the final output.

### Output:
```json
{
  "root": {
    "practice": {
      "files": [
        "index.html",
        "app.js"
      ],
      "build": {
        "files": [
          "b.jpg"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Output:
- **Directories**:
  - `root` is the root directory, and it contains `practice`.
  - Inside `practice`, there’s a `build` directory.
  
- **Files**:
  - In `practice`, there are two files: `index.html` and `app.js`.
  - In `build`, there is one file: `b.jpg` (since `a.png` was deleted earlier).

The code now works as expected, and all the operations such as creating directories, adding files, changing directories, deleting files, and deleting directories are handled correctly.
