### Explanation of the Code

This code demonstrates the **Module Pattern** in JavaScript, where a private variable is encapsulated within an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE), and only specific methods are exposed to interact with it. This approach ensures **data privacy** and prevents direct access to the private variables from outside the module.

Let's break it down:

### Structure

```javascript
const counter = (function () {
  let privateCounter = 0;  // This is the private variable.
  
  // This helper function is used to modify the privateCounter.
  function changeByValue(value) {
    privateCounter += value;
  }

  // The IIFE returns an object exposing methods to interact with the privateCounter.
  return {
    increment() {
      changeByValue(1);  // Increments privateCounter by 1
    },
    decrement() {
      changeByValue(-1); // Decrements privateCounter by 1
    },
    value() {
      return privateCounter;  // Returns the current value of privateCounter
    },
  };
})();
```

### Breakdown:

1. **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**:
   - The function is **immediately invoked** after it's defined. The entire function executes as soon as it's defined, and it returns an object containing the methods that expose the ability to interact with `privateCounter`.

2. **Private Variable (`privateCounter`)**:
   - `privateCounter` is defined **inside the IIFE** and is not directly accessible from outside the function. This ensures that `privateCounter` is **encapsulated** and cannot be directly modified from outside the IIFE.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - The function `changeByValue(value)` modifies the `privateCounter` variable, and this function is **not exposed** outside. This means that the internal logic for modifying `privateCounter` is hidden, and only the `increment`, `decrement`, and `value` methods are exposed to the outside.

4. **Exposed Methods**:
   - The IIFE returns an object with three methods:
     - **`increment()`**: Increases `privateCounter` by `1`.
     - **`decrement()`**: Decreases `privateCounter` by `1`.
     - **`value()`**: Returns the current value of `privateCounter`.

   By using these methods, the value of `privateCounter` can be modified or accessed safely, but it cannot be changed directly from outside the IIFE.

### Usage

```javascript
console.log(counter.value()); // 0.
```

- Initially, the value of `privateCounter` is `0`, so calling `counter.value()` logs `0`.

```javascript
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.value()); // 2.
```

- `counter.increment()` is called twice, so the `privateCounter` is incremented by `1` each time. After two calls to `increment()`, the value of `privateCounter` becomes `2`.
- The second `console.log(counter.value())` logs `2`.

### Key Concepts:

1. **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**:
   - The function is executed right after its definition, and the returned object exposes the necessary methods. This ensures that the internal state (`privateCounter`) remains private and cannot be directly accessed from outside.

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - The `privateCounter` is **private** to the IIFE. No other code outside this function can directly modify it. This is an example of **data privacy** in JavaScript, which is achieved using closures.

3. **Closure**:
   - The methods (`increment`, `decrement`, and `value`) form closures around the `privateCounter` variable, meaning they have access to `privateCounter` even though it's not directly available in the global scope.

### Output:

```javascript
console.log(counter.value()); // 0.
counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.value()); // 2.
```

The output will be:

```
0
2
```

### Summary:
This code demonstrates a classic pattern of data privacy using closures in JavaScript, where the internal state (`privateCounter`) is encapsulated within an IIFE and can only be accessed or modified via the exposed methods (`increment`, `decrement`, and `value`). This is a powerful pattern for creating modules in JavaScript with private variables and public methods.
