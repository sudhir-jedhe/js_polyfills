### Explanation of the Code

The code provided defines a **counter** module using closures in JavaScript, where the internal state (`privateCounter`) is kept private and can only be modified using the provided methods (`increment`, `decrement`, and `value`). This is a common JavaScript pattern known as **Module Pattern**. Let’s break down the structure and behavior of the code:

### Structure of `makeCounter` Function

```javascript
const makeCounter = function () {
  let privateCounter = 0;  // This is the private variable that holds the counter's value.
  
  function changeBy(val) {
    privateCounter += val;  // This is a helper function that modifies the private counter value.
  }

  return {
    increment() {
      changeBy(1);  // Increases the counter by 1.
    },

    decrement() {
      changeBy(-1);  // Decreases the counter by 1.
    },

    value() {
      return privateCounter;  // Returns the current value of the counter.
    },
  };
};
```

1. **Private Variable (`privateCounter`)**:
   - `privateCounter` is a variable inside the `makeCounter` function that is **not accessible directly** from outside the function. This is the core part of creating private state in JavaScript using closures.

2. **`changeBy(val)` Function**:
   - This is a helper function that modifies the value of `privateCounter`. It's used by the `increment` and `decrement` methods to change the counter's value in a controlled manner.

3. **Returned Object**:
   - The `makeCounter` function returns an object with three methods:
     - `increment`: Increments the counter by 1.
     - `decrement`: Decrements the counter by 1.
     - `value`: Returns the current value of `privateCounter`.

These methods have access to the `privateCounter` due to **closures**, meaning they can access and modify `privateCounter` even though `privateCounter` is not directly accessible from outside the function.

### Creating and Using Counter Instances

```javascript
const counter1 = makeCounter();
const counter2 = makeCounter();

console.log(counter1.value()); // 0.
```

1. `counter1` and `counter2` are two separate instances of counters. Each instance has its own private `privateCounter` variable, which means modifying `counter1`'s counter does not affect `counter2`'s counter.

2. The first `console.log(counter1.value())` outputs `0` because the counter was initialized with `privateCounter = 0`.

### Modifying the Counter

```javascript
counter1.increment();
counter1.increment();
console.log(counter1.value()); // 2.
```

1. `counter1.increment()` is called twice, each time increasing `privateCounter` by `1`. After two calls to `increment`, `privateCounter` of `counter1` becomes `2`.

2. The second `console.log(counter1.value())` outputs `2`.

```javascript
counter1.decrement();
console.log(counter1.value()); // 1.
```

1. `counter1.decrement()` is called once, which decreases `privateCounter` of `counter1` by `1`. Now, the value is `1`.

2. The next `console.log(counter1.value())` outputs `1`.

### Testing the Second Counter (`counter2`)

```javascript
console.log(counter2.value()); // 0.
```

1. `counter2` was initialized separately, so it starts with its own `privateCounter` set to `0`.

2. The `console.log(counter2.value())` outputs `0` because no operations (`increment` or `decrement`) have been performed on `counter2`.

### Summary of Output

```javascript
console.log(counter1.value()); // 0.
counter1.increment();
counter1.increment();
console.log(counter1.value()); // 2.
counter1.decrement();
console.log(counter1.value()); // 1.
console.log(counter2.value()); // 0.
```

The output will be:

```
0
2
1
0
```

### Key Concepts:
1. **Closures**: The `increment`, `decrement`, and `value` methods form closures over `privateCounter`, allowing them to access and modify its value even though it is not directly accessible from outside the `makeCounter` function.

2. **Encapsulation**: The `privateCounter` is **encapsulated** within each counter instance, making it private to the instance and preventing direct manipulation from outside the function. Instead, the methods expose controlled ways to modify and access the counter.

3. **Independence of Instances**: Each call to `makeCounter` creates a new independent counter object, meaning `counter1` and `counter2` have separate instances of `privateCounter`.
