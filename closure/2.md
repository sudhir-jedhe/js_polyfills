### Explanation of the Example:

```javascript
function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```

#### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **The `init` Function:**
   - The function `init()` is defined and it contains a local variable `name` with the value `"Mozilla"`.
   - Inside `init()`, there is another function `displayName()`, which is a **nested function**.

2. **Inner Function (`displayName`):**
   - The inner function `displayName()` is able to **access** and **use** the variable `name` that was defined in the parent function `init()`, even though `name` is not passed explicitly to it.
   - This happens because `displayName()` forms a **closure**, which allows it to "remember" and "access" the environment in which it was created (i.e., the scope of `init()`), even if `init()` has finished executing.

3. **Calling `displayName()`:**
   - Inside `init()`, after `name` is declared, `displayName()` is called, and when `displayName()` runs, it prints the value of `name` to the console.
   
4. **Closure Behavior:**
   - **Closure** is formed because `displayName()` is an inner function and still has access to the `name` variable from its parent function `init()`, even after `init()` finishes executing.
   
5. **Execution Flow:**
   - When `init()` is invoked, it executes, and inside it, `displayName()` is invoked.
   - `displayName()` prints the value of `name`, which is `"Mozilla"`, to the console.

#### Output:

```
Mozilla
```

### Key Points about Closures:
- **A closure** is a function that **remembers its lexical scope**, even when the function is executed outside that scope.
- In this case, `displayName()` is a closure that "remembers" the `name` variable from the `init()` function's scope.
- This allows functions to access variables from their outer (parent) functions even after the parent function has finished execution, as long as the inner function is still accessible.
  
### Example Showing Closure in Action:

If you modify the example to run `displayName()` outside `init()`, like so:

```javascript
var display = init();
display();
```

It will still print `"Mozilla"`, because the `displayName` function retains a reference to the `name` variable from the `init` scope. The closure allows the function to continue to "remember" that variable.

### Use Cases for Closures:
- **Data Privacy:** Closures can be used to hide variables from the global scope while still providing controlled access through inner functions (like private variables in object-oriented programming).
- **Function Factories:** Functions like `makeAdder()` (as shown in previous examples) or other higher-order functions can use closures to "remember" settings or configurations.
