### Explanation of the Example:

```javascript
function outer() {
  let getY;
  {
    const y = 6;
    getY = () => y;
  }
  console.log(typeof y); // undefined
  console.log(getY()); // 6
}

outer();
```

#### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **`outer` Function:**
   - A function `outer()` is defined, inside of which there is a block-scoped variable `getY` that will hold a reference to a function.
   
2. **Block (Inner Scope):**
   - Inside a block (`{}`), we define a `const` variable `y` with the value `6`. 
   - Inside the same block, a function `getY` is assigned a function expression `() => y`. This function **captures** and **remembers** the value of `y` due to JavaScript's closure mechanism.
   - Since `y` is declared with `const` inside the block, it is **not accessible** outside of the block, and thus trying to access it directly after the block will return `undefined`.

3. **Accessing `y` Outside the Block:**
   - When `console.log(typeof y)` is executed outside the block, it prints `undefined`. This is because `y` was declared inside the block with `const`, so its scope is limited to that block. Outside the block, `y` is not accessible, and trying to reference it results in an `undefined` value.
   
4. **Accessing `getY()`:**
   - The function `getY` is assigned inside the block and it captures the value of `y` at the time of its creation. When `getY()` is called, it has access to the value of `y` even though `y` is not accessible directly outside the block. 
   - This is a **closure** in action â€” `getY` **remembers** the environment in which it was created and can access `y` even though `y` is out of scope.
   - When `console.log(getY())` is executed, it returns `6` because `getY` remembers the value of `y` from the block's scope.

#### Output:

```
undefined
6
```

### Key Points:

1. **Block Scope:** 
   - The variable `y` is declared inside a block using `const`, so it has block scope, meaning it is only available within that block and not outside it.
   - `console.log(typeof y)` outside the block prints `undefined` because the variable `y` is not in scope at that point.

2. **Closure:**
   - The function `getY` forms a **closure** over the block scope where `y` is defined. Even though `y` is not accessible outside the block, `getY` can still access `y` due to how closures work. This is why `getY()` returns `6`.

3. **Function and Lexical Scoping:**
   - The arrow function `getY` captures the **lexical environment** where it was defined, meaning it "remembers" the value of `y` from the time it was created inside the block.

### Conclusion:

This example demonstrates the combination of **block scoping** with `const` and **closures** in JavaScript. While variables in a block are not accessible outside, functions defined within a block can still access and "remember" those block-scoped variables.
