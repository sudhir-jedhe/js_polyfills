Your examples demonstrate **closures** in JavaScript, a fundamental concept where a function retains access to variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing. Let's break them down:

### 1. **First Example - `add(x)` with Closure:**

```javascript
function add(x) {
  function addTo(y) {
    console.log(x + y);
  }
  return addTo;
}

console.log(add(10)(5));
```

#### Explanation:
- `add(x)` is a function that takes a parameter `x`.
- Inside `add(x)`, there's another function `addTo(y)` that takes a parameter `y` and logs the sum of `x` and `y`.
- The function `add(x)` returns the inner function `addTo(y)`, but importantly, `addTo(y)` still **remembers** the value of `x` from its parent function due to **closures**.
- When you call `add(10)(5)`, the following happens:
  - `add(10)` returns the `addTo` function, with the value of `x` set to `10`.
  - Then, `addTo(5)` is called, which logs `10 + 5 = 15`.

So, the output of `console.log(add(10)(5))` will be:

```
15
```

### 2. **Second Example - `makeAdder(x)` with Closures:**

```javascript
function makeAdder(x) {
  return function (y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

const add5 = makeAdder(5);
const add10 = makeAdder(10);

console.log(add5(2)); // 7
console.log(add10(2)); // 12
```

#### Explanation:
- `makeAdder(x)` is a function that takes a parameter `x`.
- It **returns a new function** that takes a parameter `y` and returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
- The returned function **remembers the value of `x`** through closures, so when we later call `add5(2)` or `add10(2)`, the function uses the value of `x` that was passed when `makeAdder(x)` was called.
  - `add5` is the result of `makeAdder(5)`, so `x = 5` in its closure.
  - `add10` is the result of `makeAdder(10)`, so `x = 10` in its closure.

When you call:

- `add5(2)`:
  - The function adds `5 + 2`, which equals `7`.
- `add10(2)`:
  - The function adds `10 + 2`, which equals `12`.

So, the output will be:

```
7
12
```

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Closures** allow an inner function to retain access to variables in its outer function's scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
2. In both examples, you're leveraging closures to **preserve the value of `x`** for use later in the returned inner function.
3. This pattern is useful for creating **customizable functions** like `makeAdder` where you can create variations of a function (e.g., adding 5 or 10) by capturing different `x` values.

These examples effectively demonstrate how JavaScript handles closures and how it allows for more powerful function compositions.
