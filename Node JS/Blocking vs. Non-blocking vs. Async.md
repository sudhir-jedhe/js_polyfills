// Understanding these concepts is key to mastering backend development and Node.js.

// 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴:
//  - In Node.js, blocking occurs when the main thread is paused due to synchronous operations, such as I/O tasks.
//  - This halts the entire event loop which is powered by Libuv until the operation is completed, potentially leading to performance issues.

// 𝗡𝗼𝗻-𝗯𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴:
//  - Non-blocking I/O allows operations to be performed without waiting for them to finish.
//  - Traditionally, this would involve constant polling, but in Node.js, the event loop efficiently manages non-blocking I/O operations.

// 𝗔𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰:
//  - Asynchronous programming enables tasks to be initiated and executed independently of the main program flow.
//  - Instead of waiting for tasks to complete, the program continues executing other tasks and is notified of completion through callback functions.
//  - This asynchronous behavior ensures that the event loop remains unblocked, enhancing performance and responsiveness.


// Node.js utilizes non-blocking I/O and asynchronous programming to optimize efficiency and scalability. Understanding these concepts is essential for building high-performance applications in Node.js.
