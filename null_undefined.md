Let's break down what each line of the JavaScript quiz does, and analyze the results.

### 1. `console.log(JSON.stringify([1, 2, null, 3]));`

- **Result**: `"[1,2,null,3]"`
  
  `JSON.stringify` converts an array into a JSON string. `null` will be included as it is, and the result is a string representation of the array with `null` included.

---

### 2. `console.log(JSON.stringify([1, 2, undefined, 3]));`

- **Result**: `"[1,2,null,3]"`
  
  When `JSON.stringify` encounters `undefined`, it **omits** `undefined` from the resulting JSON string. Thus, `undefined` is not included, and the output becomes `[1, 2, null, 3]`.

---

### 3. `console.log(null === undefined);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  `===` is the **strict equality** operator. It checks both the type and the value of the operands. Since `null` is of type `object` and `undefined` is of type `undefined`, they are not strictly equal.

---

### 4. `console.log(null == undefined);`

- **Result**: `true`
  
  `==` is the **loose equality** operator. It does type coercion before comparison, and according to JavaScript's rules, `null` and `undefined` are considered equal when using `==`.

---

### 5. `console.log(null == 0);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  `null` is only loosely equal to `undefined`, but not to other values like `0` or `false`. So, the result is `false`.

---

### 6. `console.log(null < 0);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  When comparing `null` with numbers, `null` is treated as `0`. Therefore, `null < 0` evaluates as `0 < 0`, which is `false`.

---

### 7. `console.log(null > 0);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  Similarly, `null` is treated as `0` when compared with numbers. Thus, `null > 0` evaluates as `0 > 0`, which is `false`.

---

### 8. `console.log(null <= 0);`

- **Result**: `true`
  
  Since `null` is treated as `0` in numeric comparisons, this becomes `0 <= 0`, which is `true`.

---

### 9. `console.log(null >= 0);`

- **Result**: `true`
  
  Similarly, `null` is treated as `0`, so `null >= 0` evaluates as `0 >= 0`, which is `true`.

---

### 10. `console.log(undefined == 0);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  `undefined` is not equal to `0` using the loose equality operator. The comparison `undefined == 0` returns `false`.

---

### 11. `console.log(undefined < 0);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  `undefined` is not comparable to numbers in a way that gives a meaningful result. The comparison `undefined < 0` evaluates as `false` because `undefined` is coerced to `NaN`, and `NaN` is not less than `0`.

---

### 12. `console.log(undefined > 0);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  Similar to the previous case, `undefined` is coerced to `NaN`, and `NaN` is not greater than `0`, so the result is `false`.

---

### 13. `console.log(undefined <= 0);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  `undefined` is coerced to `NaN` again, and the comparison `NaN <= 0` is `false`.

---

### 14. `console.log(undefined >= 0);`

- **Result**: `false`
  
  Again, `undefined` is treated as `NaN`, and `NaN` is not greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, the result is `false`.

---

### Summary of Results:

- **Stringify Output:**
  - `"[1,2,null,3]"`
  - `"[1,2,null,3]"`

- **Comparisons**:
  - `null === undefined`: `false`
  - `null == undefined`: `true`
  - `null == 0`: `false`
  - `null < 0`: `false`
  - `null > 0`: `false`
  - `null <= 0`: `true`
  - `null >= 0`: `true`
  - `undefined == 0`: `false`
  - `undefined < 0`: `false`
  - `undefined > 0`: `false`
  - `undefined <= 0`: `false`
  - `undefined >= 0`: `false`

---

### Key Takeaways:

- `null` and `undefined` are **loosely equal** (`==`), but not **strictly equal** (`===`).
- When compared with numbers, `null` is treated as `0`, but `undefined` cannot be meaningfully compared to numbers, so the result is always `false`.
- `JSON.stringify` omits `undefined` but includes `null` in the output.

This quiz tests your understanding of JavaScript's type coercion and equality operators, as well as how `JSON.stringify` handles `null` and `undefined`.
