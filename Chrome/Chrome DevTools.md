### 1. Performance Panel

Most developers open it only when someone says, "The app feels slow."
But it can tell you:
✓ Which function blocked the main thread
✓ Which component caused excessive rendering
✓ Where frames dropped and caused UI lag
✓ Why scrolling feels janky
Instead of guessing, you can see exactly where the time is being spent.

### 2. Memory Panel

One of the most underused tabs.
It helps identify:
✓ Detached DOM nodes
✓ Event listeners that were never cleaned up
✓ Memory leaks caused by timers
✓ Objects that stay in memory longer than expected
If your application gets slower after running for a while, this tab can save hours of investigation.

### 3. Network Request Blocking

Ever wanted to know what happens if an API fails?
You don't need backend changes.
Simply block a request and instantly test:
✓ Error states
✓ Retry mechanisms
✓ Fallback UI
✓ Loading behavior
A great way to test edge cases before users find them.

### 4. Coverage Tab

This one surprised me.
Open Coverage and reload your application.
You'll discover how much JavaScript and CSS is downloaded but never used.
Sometimes you're shipping hundreds of KBs that users never need.

### 5. Event Listener Breakpoints

Instead of searching through thousands of lines of code to find who triggered something:
Set an Event Listener Breakpoint.
Click the action.
DevTools pauses exactly where the event originated.
It's like having a GPS for bugs.

### 6. Live Expressions

Need to monitor a value continuously?
Create a Live Expression.
No more repetitive console.logs.
The value updates automatically as your application changes.

### 7. Layers Panel

Ever seen:
"Why is this element behind another element?"
"Why is z-index not working?"
The Layers panel visualizes how the browser is actually rendering your UI.
