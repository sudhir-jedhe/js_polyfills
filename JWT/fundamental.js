// JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) Explained

//  - Think of a JWT like a tiny package with three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.
//  - Header: Says how the package is locked and secured.
//  - Payload: Holds important stuff like who you are or what you can do.
//  - Signature: Makes sure nobody messes with the package.

// Example: A JWT looks something like this: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"

//  - JWTs do the same online! They help websites know who you are and what you're allowed to do.

// 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗔𝗿𝗲 𝗝𝗪𝗧𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲?
//  - Signature: It's like a lock on the package, making sure it hasn't been messed with.
//  - It keeps sensitive info safe and sets a time limit on how long the package can be used.

//  1. You tell the website who you are.
//  2. The website gives you a special online ID card (JWT).
//  3. You show your ID card whenever you need to do something on the website.
//  4. The website checks your ID card to make sure it's real and hasn't expired.

//  - They don't need a big storage space on the website.
