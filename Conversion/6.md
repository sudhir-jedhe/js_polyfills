### Corrected Code:

```js
const arr = [];

// Set values in the array
arr[10] = 10;
arr[100] = undefined;  // Just for clarity

// Log "Hi" for each element in the array (only sparse indices are considered)
arr.forEach(() => console.log("Hi"));
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sparse Array**: 
   - When you assign values like `arr[10] = 10;` and `arr[100];` to an array, you are creating a **sparse array**. This means that the array has "holes" (empty slots) between index `0` and `100`, but the values are not contiguous. The array will look like `[ <10 empty items>, 10, <90 empty items>, undefined ]`.
   - These "holes" are considered empty slots, so `forEach` will not loop through them unless you explicitly set values in those slots.

2. **`arr.forEach(() => console.log("Hi"))`**:
   - `forEach` iterates over each index that has a defined value. However, because `arr` is sparse, it will only run the `console.log("Hi")` for the indices that are set (in this case, `10` and `100`).
   - If you want `forEach` to run for each index (including those that are sparse), you would need to use a `for` loop, since `forEach` skips over empty slots in sparse arrays.

### Output:
This code will log `Hi` for each non-sparse index in the array. In this case, since we set values at indices `10` and `100`, it will log `"Hi"` two times, one for each of those indices.

```
Hi
Hi
```

### To Iterate Over All Array Indices (Including Sparse):
If you want to iterate over all indices, including sparse ones, and log `"Hi"`, you could use a traditional `for` loop instead:

```js
const arr = [];

// Set values in the array
arr[10] = 10;
arr[100] = undefined;

// Log "Hi" for every index, including sparse ones
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log("Hi");
}
```

This would log `"Hi"` for each index from `0` to `100`, including the "empty" indices, because a `for` loop doesn't skip over sparse array slots.

### Final Thoughts:
- **Sparse Arrays**: Arrays with holes (undefined slots) are considered "sparse arrays" in JavaScript. `forEach` and other array methods don't execute on these empty slots.
- **`forEach` with Callback**: Be sure to pass a function (e.g., an arrow function or a named function) when using `forEach`.
- **Traditional `for` Loop**: For guaranteed iteration over all indices, including sparse ones, you can use a `for` loop.
