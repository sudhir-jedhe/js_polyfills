The code you've written contains a syntax error due to the missing semicolon between the variable declarations:

```js
let a = "first" let b = "second";
```

It should be:

```js
let a = "first"; 
let b = "second";
```

Now, let's break down the expression `a && b?` after fixing the syntax.

### Expression: `a && b`

In JavaScript, the **logical AND (`&&`)** operator returns the **first falsy operand** it encounters, or the **last operand** if all operands are truthy.

### Step-by-step evaluation:

1. **`a = "first"`**: This is a non-empty string, which is a **truthy** value.
2. **`b = "second"`**: This is also a non-empty string, which is a **truthy** value.

Since both `a` and `b` are truthy, the **`&&`** operator will return the **second operand** (`b`), which is `"second"`.

### Final Result:

```js
a && b // Output: "second"
```

### Summary:
- Since both `a` and `b` are truthy values, the `&&` operator will return the second operand, which is `"second"` && check from left to right and  dosent convert result to boolean.

to conver to boolean

```js
!!a && b // Output: "true"
