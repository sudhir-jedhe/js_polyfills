It looks like you've made a few syntax errors in your JavaScript code. Let's break it down and correct it.

### Issues in the code:
1. **`console show`**: You should use `console.log(show)` instead of `console show` to log a value to the console.
2. **`consloe 'Sudhir'`**: This is a typo, it should be `console.log('Sudhir')`.

### Corrected Code:
```js
var show = 1;  // Declare a variable `show` with value 1

console.log(show);  // Log the value of `show`, should print 1

function show() {
  console.log('Sudhir');  // Log 'Sudhir' inside the function, this won't be called yet.
}

console.log(show);  // Log the value of `show` again, but the value of `show` is the function now.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable Declaration with `var`**:
   - You first declare a variable `show` with the value `1`.
   - JavaScript hoists function declarations, so it treats `show` as a function (because you define `show` as a function later). This causes the variable `show` (with value `1`) to be overwritten by the function declaration.

2. **First `console.log(show)`**:
   - Before the function declaration, `show` is just a variable with the value `1`, so this will print `1` to the console.

3. **Function Declaration**:
   - You define a function called `show()`, but because of **hoisting**, the function declaration is lifted to the top. The variable `show` will now reference the function, not the number `1`.

4. **Second `console.log(show)`**:
   - After the function declaration, `show` now refers to the function, so `console.log(show)` will log the function definition (not `1`), and the output will show something like `[Function: show]`.

**Function  gets Highest priority for hoisting then with variable show**

### Final Output:
```
1
[Function: show]
```

### Key Points:
- **Hoisting**: JavaScript hoists **function declarations** and **variable declarations** (with `var`). In this case, the function declaration `show()` is hoisted, overwriting the initial value of the `show` variable (which was `1`).
- **`console.log()`**: Used to output values to the console. Make sure to use it correctly to avoid errors.
