You're correct! In JavaScript, when using destructuring in a statement like the one you provided, the expression needs to be wrapped in parentheses to avoid a syntax error. This is because JavaScript interprets the `{}` as a block of code rather than an object literal when it appears on the left-hand side of an assignment.

Let me explain this in more detail:

### Issue:
```javascript
{x: obj['name']} = {x: "Sagar"}; // This will throw a syntax error as try to create scope which is syntactically incorrect
```

In the above line, `{x: obj['name']}` is being interpreted as a block of code, not an object literal. This results in a syntax error.

### Solution:
To fix the issue, you need to wrap the destructuring assignment in parentheses to tell JavaScript that you are destructuring an object and not defining a block of code.

### Corrected Code:
```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "Sudhir"
};

// Destructure and assign values
({x: obj['name']} = {x: "Sagar"}); // Wrap the expression in parentheses

console.log(obj); // Logs: { name: "Sagar" }
```

### Explanation:

1. **Destructuring**: `({x: obj['name']})` tells JavaScript that we are destructuring an object, and the `x` property is being assigned to `obj['name']`.
   
2. **Assignment**: `{x: "Sagar"}` is an object, and `x` is being assigned the value `"Sagar"`, which is then used to update `obj['name']`.

3. **Why Parentheses?**: Without the parentheses, JavaScript would interpret the `{}` as a block of code (a code block with no statements), which causes a syntax error. The parentheses tell JavaScript that this is an object destructuring expression.

### Final Output:

```javascript
{ name: "Sagar" }
```

By wrapping the expression in parentheses, the code works as expected and modifies the `name` property of `obj` to `"Sagar"`.
