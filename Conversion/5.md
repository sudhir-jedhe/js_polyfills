In JavaScript, when you use `let` inside a `switch` case, the scope of the `let` variable is block-scoped. However, if you don't use curly braces (`{}`) around the `case` block, the scope may be different than you expect. Let's look at the behavior with and without curly braces.

### Understanding Block Scope with `let` in `switch`:

When you use `let` in a `switch` case without curly braces, the variable `let` will be scoped to the entire `switch` block, not just the specific `case`.

### Scenario 1: Without Curly Braces

```js
let x = 0;
switch (x) {
  case 0:
    let a = 10;
    console.log(a); // Outputs: 10
    break;
  case 1:
    console.log(a); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
    break;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- `let a = 10;` inside `case 0` creates a block-scoped variable `a`, but because no curly braces are used, `a` is scoped to the entire `switch` statement.
- When the code jumps to `case 1`, it tries to reference `a`, but since `let` variables are **block-scoped**, `a` is not accessible outside of `case 0`. This leads to a **`ReferenceError`** in `case 1`.

### Scenario 2: With Curly Braces

Using curly braces around the `case` blocks will properly scope the `let` variable to each individual case.

```js
let x = 0;
switch (x) {
  case 0: {
    let a = 10;
    console.log(a); // Outputs: 10
    break;
  }
  case 1: {
    let a = 20;  // This 'a' is scoped to this block
    console.log(a); // Outputs: 20
    break;
  }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Block Scoping with `{}`**: When you use curly braces, each `case` has its own scope for the variable `a`.
- In this case, `a` in `case 0` is not accessible in `case 1`, and `a` in `case 1` is scoped only to `case 1`, avoiding conflicts.

### Key Points:
1. **Block scoping of `let`**: `let` variables are scoped to the block they are declared in. Without curly braces in a `switch` statement, the variable is scoped to the entire `switch`, which is not the desired behavior.
2. **Using curly braces**: Wrapping each `case` in curly braces ensures that the `let` variable is scoped correctly to each `case`.
3. **Avoiding variable hoisting issues**: The issue of variable scope hoisting in a `switch` can lead to bugs, so itâ€™s a best practice to always use curly braces in `switch` cases when declaring `let` variables.

### Best Practice:

Even if you want to avoid using curly braces for other reasons, **you should always use them** when declaring `let` or `const` variables in `switch` cases to avoid scope-related issues.

### Example with Curly Braces for Proper Scoping:

```js
let x = 0;
switch (x) {
  case 0: {
    let a = 10;
    console.log(a);  // 10
    break;
  }
  case 1: {
    let a = 20;
    console.log(a);  // 20
    break;
  }
}
```

This will work as expected without any scope issues.
