Let's walk through the three variations of your code and explain the outcomes and differences clearly.

### 1. **Code with `console.log(z);` and no declaration**:
```js
console.log(z);
z = 1;
```

#### Explanation:
- **`console.log(z)`** tries to log the value of `z` before it's declared or initialized.
- If `z` is **not declared** anywhere in your code, this will throw a **ReferenceError** in **strict mode** because accessing an undeclared variable is not allowed.
- **In non-strict mode**, this would not throw an error and would implicitly create a global variable `z`. However, this is bad practice and should be avoided.

#### Outcome (in strict mode):
```
ReferenceError: z is not defined
```

### 2. **Code with `var` declaration**:
```js
console.log(z);
var z = 1;
```

#### Explanation:
- **`console.log(z)`** is executed before the `var z = 1;` declaration.
- In JavaScript, **`var` declarations are hoisted** to the top of their scope (the top of the function or the global scope), but **only the declaration is hoisted**, not the assignment.
- Therefore, the code behaves like this (due to hoisting):
    ```js
    var z;  // Declaration is hoisted to the top
    console.log(z);  // Logs 'undefined' because z is declared but not yet assigned a value
    z = 1;  // Assignment happens here
    ```

#### Outcome (in strict mode or non-strict mode):
```
undefined
```
- The value `undefined` is logged because the `var` declaration is hoisted, but the assignment happens after the `console.log()` statement.

### 3. **Code with `let` declaration**:
```js
console.log(z);
let z = 1;
```

#### Explanation:
- **`console.log(z)`** is executed before `let z = 1;` is declared.
- **`let` declarations are also hoisted**, but they are not initialized until the actual line of code that declares them is reached. This results in the variable being in a "temporal dead zone" between the start of the block and the point where it is actually declared.
- Accessing a variable in the **temporal dead zone** will throw a **ReferenceError**.

#### Outcome (in strict mode or non-strict mode):
```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization
```

- This occurs because `let` has block-scoping and is not initialized until the line where `let z = 1;` is executed. Until that line, `z` is in the "temporal dead zone", and any attempt to access it before that results in a `ReferenceError`.

### Summary of Differences:

| **Code**                       | **Explanation**                                      | **Outcome**                |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `console.log(z); z = 1;`        | `z` is not declared, throws a `ReferenceError` in strict mode. | `ReferenceError: z is not defined` |
| `console.log(z); var z = 1;`    | `var` declarations are hoisted, but only the declaration, not the assignment. Logs `undefined`. | `undefined`                |
| `console.log(z); let z = 1;`    | `let` variables are hoisted but cannot be accessed before their declaration (temporal dead zone). | `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization` |

### Key Takeaways:

1. **`var`**: 
   - Declarations are hoisted, but **assignments** are not. If you try to log a `var` variable before itâ€™s assigned, it will log `undefined`.

2. **`let` and `const`**:
   - Both are hoisted, but they cannot be accessed before the declaration (due to the temporal dead zone).
   - Attempting to access them before initialization throws a `ReferenceError`.

3. **Strict Mode**:
   - Strict mode enforces stricter parsing and error handling, preventing certain actions such as using undeclared variables. 

### Best Practice:
- Always declare variables before using them with `let`, `const`, or `var` to avoid unexpected behavior and errors, especially in strict mode.
- Avoid using `var` if possible in modern JavaScript. Prefer `let` or `const` for better scoping and avoiding issues with hoisting.
