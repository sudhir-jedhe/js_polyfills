It looks like you've written some JavaScript code with a few syntax and logical issues. Let's go step by step and correct them:

### Original Code:
```js
const lang = "js"
if (0 === 1) { lang = 'react' }
log(j)
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Reassigning a `const` variable**: 
   - `const` in JavaScript creates a **read-only** variable, meaning you **cannot reassign** its value after it's declared. So, trying to reassign `lang` inside the `if` block would result in a **TypeError**.
   
2. **`log(j)`**:
   - `log(j)` is not defined anywhere. You might have intended to use `console.log(j)` instead.

3. **Syntax**:
   - Missing semicolons after variable declarations (though not strictly required in JavaScript, it's a good practice).

### Corrected Code:

```js
let lang = "js"; // use 'let' instead of 'const' to allow reassignment
if (0 === 1) {
  lang = 'react'; // This line will not execute because the condition is false
}
console.log(lang); // Logs the value of lang
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`let lang = "js";`**:
   - I changed `const` to `let` so that you can reassign the variable `lang` if necessary.
   
2. **Condition `if (0 === 1)`**:
   - This condition is **false**, so the block inside `{ lang = 'react' }` won't execute. Hence, `lang` will remain `"js"`.

3. **`console.log(lang);`**:
   - Fixed the typo. You need to use `console.log` to output to the console.

### Final Output:
Since `0 === 1` is `false`, the condition will not execute, and `lang` will remain `"js"`. So, the output will be:

```js
js
```

The code you provided will throw an error because you are trying to reassign a `const` variable.

### Code:
```js
const lang = "js"; 
if (0 === 0) { // True condition to change lang
  lang = 'react';  // This will cause an error because `lang` is a `const`
}
console.log(lang);
```

### Explanation:
1. **`const lang = "js";`**: 
   - `lang` is declared with the `const` keyword, which means it is a **constant** and cannot be reassigned.
   - So, once `lang` is assigned `"js"`, it is **immutable** and cannot be changed later.

2. **`if (0 === 0)`**: 
   - This condition is **true**, so the block inside the `if` statement will execute.
   
3. **`lang = 'react';`**: 
   - This attempts to reassign the value of `lang` to `'react'`. However, since `lang` is declared with `const`, **this reassignment will throw an error**.

### Error:
The JavaScript engine will throw the following error:

```
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

### Why does this happen?
- `const` variables are **read-only** after their initial assignment. Once you declare a variable with `const`, you cannot reassign it, regardless of the condition or any code logic.
  
### How to fix it?
If you want to be able to reassign `lang`, you should use the `let` keyword instead of `const`:

```js
let lang = "js"; 
if (0 === 0) { // True condition to change lang
  lang = 'react'; // This is allowed because `lang` is now declared with `let`
}
console.log(lang); // Output: 'react'
```

### Final Output with `let`:
```
react
```

### Summary:
- **`const`**: The value assigned to a `const` variable cannot be reassigned. It must remain constant.
- **`let`**: If you want to reassign the variable, use `let`.
- 

### Alternative: If you want to change `lang` when `0 === 1` is true:
```js
let lang = "js";
if (0 === 0) { // True condition to change lang
  lang = 'react'; 
}
console.log(lang); // Logs the updated value 'react'
```

Now the output would be:

```js
react
```
