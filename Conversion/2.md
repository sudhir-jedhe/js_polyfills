The code you provided:

```js
[a] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(a);
```

### Explanation:

This code uses **destructuring assignment**. Let's break it down:

1. **Destructuring Array**: The expression `[a] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is an **array destructuring assignment**.
   - Here, the left side `[a]` is an array pattern, and the right side `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is an array.
   - The pattern `[a]` extracts the **first element** of the array on the right side and assigns it to the variable `a`.

2. **What happens during destructuring?**
   - `a` will be assigned the first value from the array `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is `2`.

So, the variable `a` gets the value `2`.

### Final Result:

```js
console.log(a); // Output: 2
```

### Summary:

- The **destructuring** pattern `[a]` extracts the **first element** of the array on the right-hand side and assigns it to the variable `a`.
- In this case, `a` gets the value `2` because it's the first element in the array `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

The output will be:
```js
2
```
