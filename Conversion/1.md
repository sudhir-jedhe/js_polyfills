In JavaScript, the **`+` operator** can either perform **addition** (if both operands are numbers) or **string concatenation** (if one of the operands is a string). The **expression evaluation** order is indeed **left-to-right** for most operators, but the behavior of the `+` operator when applied to different types (numbers and strings) is important to understand.

Let's break down the two examples you provided:

### 1. **`console.log("2" + 1 + 1)`**
- **Step-by-step evaluation**:
  1. `"2" + 1`: The first operation involves a string (`"2"`) and a number (`1`). Since the string `"2"` is involved, JavaScript will convert the number to a string and concatenate them.
     - Result: `"21"` (string concatenation).
  2. `"21" + 1`: Now, `"21"` is a string, and `1` is a number. Again, since a string is involved, JavaScript will convert the number `1` to a string and concatenate them.
     - Result: `"211"` (string concatenation).
  
  So, the final output is:
  ```js
  console.log("2" + 1 + 1)  // Output: "211"
  ```

### 2. **`console.log(2 + 1 + "1")`**
- **Step-by-step evaluation**:
  1. `2 + 1`: Both operands are numbers, so JavaScript will perform the **addition**.
     - Result: `3`.
  2. `3 + "1"`: Now, we have a number (`3`) and a string (`"1"`). Since the string `"1"` is involved, JavaScript will convert the number `3` to a string and concatenate them.
     - Result: `"31"` (**string concatenation**).
  
  So, the final output is:
  ```js
  console.log(2 + 1 + "1")  // Output: "31"
  ```

### Key Points:
1. **Left-to-right evaluation**: JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right.
2. **String concatenation wins**: When the `+` operator encounters a **string** and a **number**, it **converts the number to a string** and concatenates them, rather than performing arithmetic addition.

### Summary:

- In the first case (`"2" + 1 + 1`), the string `"2"` causes the entire expression to be evaluated as string concatenation, producing `"211"`.
- In the second case (`2 + 1 + "1"`), the first two operands (`2 + 1`) are numbers, so they are added to give `3`, and then the string `"1"` is concatenated, resulting in `"31"`.

This behavior demonstrates the importance of understanding how JavaScript handles type coercion and the **order of operations** when using the `+` operator with mixed data types (numbers and strings).


The expression:

```javascript
let str1 = 10;
let str2 = "20";
str2 - str1;
```

### Explanation:
1. **`str2` is a string**: `"20"`
2. **`str1` is a number**: `10`

When you use the **`-` (subtraction) operator** between a string and a number in JavaScript, JavaScript will attempt to **convert** the string into a number before performing the subtraction. This process is called **type coercion**.

### How Type Coercion Works:
- JavaScript will attempt to **convert the string `"20"`** to a number because it is involved in a mathematical operation.
- `"20"` can be successfully converted to `20` because it's a valid numeric string.
- Then, the operation `20 - 10` is performed.

### Result:
- The result of `20 - 10` is `10`.

### Final Output:

```javascript
console.log(str2 - str1);  // Output: 10
```

### Key Points:
- When performing arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` between a **string and a number**, JavaScript automatically converts the string to a number (if possible).
- In this case, `"20"` gets converted to the number `20`, and then the subtraction is performed.
