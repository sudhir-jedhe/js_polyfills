Let's break down what happens when you run this code.

### Code Explanation:
```javascript
function A() {
  this.dev1 = "BFE"; // this sets the dev1 property on the instance of A
  this.dev2 = "dev"; // this sets the dev2 property on the instance of A
  return {
    dev1: "bigfrontend", // this is the returned object that overrides dev1
  };
}

const a = new A(); // we are creating an instance of A
console.log(a.dev1); // this logs dev1 from the returned object
console.log(a.dev2); // this logs dev2 from the instance of A
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Inside the constructor `A()`:**
   - You have two properties: `dev1` and `dev2`, which are set to `"BFE"` and `"dev"`, respectively, on `this` (the instance of `A`).
   - However, at the end of the constructor, you're **explicitly returning an object**: `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }`.

2. **`new A()` invocation:**
   - When `new A()` is called, the constructor function is executed. Normally, the `new` operator creates a new empty object, and within the constructor, `this` refers to that new object.
   - The return value of a constructor function is typically the new object (`this`). However, **if a constructor explicitly returns an object**, that object is used instead of the newly created object. In your case, you are returning an object: `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }`.

3. **What happens when `return { dev1: "bigfrontend" }` is executed?**
   - This effectively **overrides** the `this` object and returns `{ dev1: "bigfrontend" }` instead of the default object that was being created with `dev1` and `dev2` properties set to `"BFE"` and `"dev"`.
   
4. **Properties of the returned object:**
   - The returned object has only one property: `dev1` set to `"bigfrontend"`.
   - The property `dev2` (which was initially set to `"dev"`) is not returned because the constructor returned a new object, which doesn't have `dev2`.

### Output:

- `console.log(a.dev1);`: The value of `dev1` in the returned object is `"bigfrontend"`, so this logs `"bigfrontend"`.
- `console.log(a.dev2);`: Since `dev2` is not part of the returned object and wasn't overridden in the constructor's return object, it logs `undefined`, because the returned object doesn't have `dev2`.

### Final Output:
```javascript
bigfrontend
undefined
```

### Key Points:
- When you return an object from a constructor, it **replaces** the instance (`this`) object created by `new`.
- Properties that are set on `this` inside the constructor will still be available unless they are overwritten by the returned object.
