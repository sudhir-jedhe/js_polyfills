# The Event Loop

The event loop is the mechanism that lets single-threaded JavaScript handle asynchronous operations without blocking — it's the single most-tested "how does JS actually work" topic in senior interviews, because getting execution order wrong reveals a shallow understanding of the language. This topic breaks down the call stack, the Web/Node APIs that run async work outside JS, and the two-queue system (macrotasks vs. microtasks) that governs exactly when deferred callbacks run. The centerpiece is the rule that determines nearly every "what logs in what order" interview question: **all queued microtasks fully drain before the event loop proceeds to the next macrotask** — which is precisely why a `Promise.then()` callback always beats a `setTimeout(fn, 0)` callback, no matter how the code is arranged.

## What's covered
- The call stack
- Web APIs / Node APIs as the environment that provides async capabilities
- Macrotask (callback) queue vs. microtask queue
- The exact rule: all microtasks drain before the next macrotask
- Why `Promise.then` callbacks run before `setTimeout(fn, 0)`
- `requestAnimationFrame`'s relationship to the loop (brief)
- A fully worked trace of a mixed sync/`setTimeout`/Promise example with exact log order and reasoning
- Browser vs. Node differences (`process.nextTick` priority in Node, briefly)

## Folder structure
- `theory/` — concept-split reference notes (call stack & host APIs, macro/microtasks, a fully worked trace, `requestAnimationFrame`, browser vs. Node)
- `snippets/` — one focused runnable snippet per file
- `output-based/` — one "predict the output" question per file, with the answer and reasoning
- `scenarios/` — one real-world design scenario per file, with a worked approach
- `interview-qa/` — quickfire Q&A grouped by theme
- `problems/` — hands-on challenges (predict-and-verify execution order, measuring real event loop lag, a reusable `yieldToEventLoop()` utility)
- `assets/` — placeholder for images/PDFs from your original notes
