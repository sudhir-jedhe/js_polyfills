Here are answers to your questions about Redux:

### 1. **How to make an AJAX request in Redux?**
In Redux, AJAX requests can be handled in actions, typically through middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga`. Here's how you can make an AJAX request with `redux-thunk`:

```javascript
// Action creator with redux-thunk
const fetchData = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_REQUEST' });
    
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => {
        dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS', payload: data });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_FAILURE', error });
      });
  };
};
```

### 2. **Should I keep all a component's state in the Redux store?**
No, not all component state should be stored in Redux. Redux is useful for managing global application state that needs to be shared across multiple components, such as user authentication status or app configuration. Component-specific state, like form inputs or UI state, should remain in the component's local state using `useState` or class component state.

### 3. **What is the proper way to access the Redux store?**
To access the Redux store in a React component, use the `useSelector` hook (for functional components) or `connect` (for class components):

```javascript
// Functional component with useSelector
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const data = useSelector((state) => state.data);
  return <div>{data}</div>;
};
```

For class components, use `connect`:

```javascript
// Class component with connect
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.data}</div>;
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  data: state.data,
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent);
```

### 4. **What is the difference between a component and a container in React Redux?**
- **Component:** A presentational component responsible for UI rendering. It doesn’t handle state or logic.
- **Container:** A component that is connected to the Redux store (via `connect` or `useSelector`) and provides data to presentational components, often containing logic and dispatching actions.

### 5. **What is the purpose of constants in Redux?**
Constants are used in Redux to define action types in a single place, preventing errors caused by string typos and improving maintainability. For example:

```javascript
// constants.js
export const FETCH_DATA_REQUEST = 'FETCH_DATA_REQUEST';
export const FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS = 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS';
```

### 6. **What are the different ways to write mapDispatchToProps()?**
- **Using Object Notation (shorthand):**
```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  fetchData,
};
```

- **Using Function Notation:**
```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    fetchData: () => dispatch(fetchData()),
  };
};
```

### 7. **What is the use of the ownProps parameter in mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps()?**
`ownProps` is the props that are passed to the component itself. This is useful if you want to map state or dispatch to props based on the component's own props.

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
  return {
    data: state.data[ownProps.id],
  };
};
```

### 8. **How to structure Redux top-level directories?**
A common directory structure is:
```
src/
  ├── actions/
  ├── reducers/
  ├── store/
  ├── constants/
  ├── components/
  └── containers/
```
- **actions**: Contains action creators.
- **reducers**: Contains reducers and combines them using `combineReducers`.
- **store**: Contains store configuration.
- **constants**: Stores action type constants.

### 9. **What is redux-saga?**
`redux-saga` is a middleware library that handles side effects in Redux. It uses generator functions to manage async operations like API requests, enabling more complex logic with better testability and error handling.

### 10. **What is the mental model of redux-saga?**
Redux-saga listens to dispatched actions and performs side effects (e.g., API calls) in a separate thread using generator functions. It uses effects like `call` (for async calls) and `put` (for dispatching actions) to handle asynchronous workflows in a more declarative way.

### 11. **What are the differences between call and put in redux-saga?**
- **call**: Used to invoke a function or API call.
- **put**: Dispatches an action to the Redux store.

```javascript
import { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';

function* fetchDataSaga() {
  try {
    const data = yield call(fetchDataFromAPI);
    yield put({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_SUCCESS', payload: data });
  } catch (error) {
    yield put({ type: 'FETCH_DATA_FAILURE', error });
  }
}
```

### 12. **What is Redux Thunk?**
Redux Thunk is middleware that allows action creators to return functions instead of plain action objects. This is useful for handling async actions, like API requests.

### 13. **What are the differences between redux-saga and redux-thunk?**
- **redux-thunk**: Handles async actions by dispatching functions, enabling side effects inside action creators.
- **redux-saga**: Uses generator functions to manage complex async workflows and side effects, providing more control over the flow and better error handling.

### 14. **What is Redux DevTools?**
Redux DevTools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect the Redux store, track state changes, and replay actions to debug your application.

### 15. **What are the features of Redux DevTools?**
- Time-travel debugging.
- State inspection and modification.
- Action replay and recording.
- Ability to save state snapshots.

### 16. **What are Redux selectors and why use them?**
Selectors are functions that extract specific slices of the state from the Redux store. They help to optimize re-renders by memoizing results.

```javascript
const selectUser = (state) => state.user;
```

### 17. **What is Redux Form?**
Redux Form is a library that integrates form state management with Redux, enabling you to manage form values, validation, and submission in the Redux store.

### 18. **What are the main features of Redux Form?**
- Form state management in Redux.
- Validation and submission handling.
- Easy integration with form components.

### 19. **How to add multiple middlewares to Redux?**
You can add multiple middlewares by passing them to `applyMiddleware` when creating the store:

```javascript
import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import logger from 'redux-logger';

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(thunk, logger)
);
```

### 20. **How to set the initial state in Redux?**
Initial state is defined in the reducer:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  data: [],
};

function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  // reducer logic
}
```

### 21. **How is Relay different from Redux?**
Relay is a data-fetching library that integrates with GraphQL, providing automatic data fetching, caching, and state management. Redux is a state management library, typically used for managing local and global application state.

### 22. **What is an action in Redux?**
An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes a change in the state. It must have a `type` property that describes the action and can optionally include a `payload`.

```javascript
const action = {
  type: 'ADD_ITEM',
  payload: { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
};
```
