The task here is to move all zeros in an array to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements. Let's break down and discuss each approach you’ve shared, and then I'll summarize the optimal solution.

### **1. First Approach: Two-pass approach with index tracking**

```javascript
function moveZeros(list) {
  let index = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    if (list[i] != 0) {
      list[index++] = list[i];
    }
  }
  for (let i = index; i < list.length; i++) {
    list[i] = 0;
  }
  return list;
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- **First loop**: Iterate over the array and shift all non-zero elements to the front, updating the `index` to track where the next non-zero element should go.
- **Second loop**: After all non-zero elements are moved to the front, fill the rest of the array with zeros, starting from the `index` position.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the array. This is an efficient approach since it only requires two passes over the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since this approach modifies the list in place.

### **2. Second Approach: Using `sort()` method**

```javascript
function moveZeros(list) {
  list.sort((a, b) =>  {
    if (a === 0) {
      return 1;
    } 
    if (b === 0) {
      return -1;
    }
    return 0;
  });
}
const list = [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 6];
moveZeros(list);
console.log(list);  // [1, 2, 3, 6, 0, 0]
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The `sort()` method is used to rearrange the elements so that all zeros appear at the end.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), because `sort()` generally has a time complexity of O(n log n) in most JavaScript engines.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if the sort is done in place (depending on the engine's sorting algorithm).
- **Downside**: This approach does not maintain the relative order of non-zero elements (though for simple cases, it may seem fine). Sorting relies on element comparison, and you could run into edge cases where the sorting is not stable (though modern JavaScript engines often provide stable sorts).

### **3. Third Approach: Swapping non-zero elements to the front**

```javascript
function moveZeros(list) {
  let start = 0;
  for (let index = 0; index < list.length; index++) {
    if (list[index] !== 0) {
      [list[start++], list[index]] = [list[index], list[start]];
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- **One-pass approach**: The idea is to swap non-zero elements with zeros, moving the non-zero elements towards the start.
- The `start` variable tracks where the next non-zero element should go. Every time a non-zero element is found, it's swapped with the element at `start`.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as it only requires one pass through the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the list is modified in place.

### **4. Fourth Approach: Iterative swapping with `while` loop**

```javascript
function moveZeros(list) {
  for(let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    if (list[i] === 0) {
      let j = i + 1;
      while (j < list.length) {
        if (list[j] !== 0) {
          [list[j], list[i]] = [list[i], list[j]];
          break;
        }
        j++;
      }
    }
  }
  return list;
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- This approach iterates over the list and, when a zero is encountered, it searches for the next non-zero element (using a `while` loop). When it finds a non-zero element, it swaps it with the zero.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in the worst case, since for every zero encountered, we may need to scan the entire rest of the list to find the next non-zero element. This makes it less efficient than the O(n) solutions above.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it modifies the list in place.

### **Optimal Solution: Two-pass approach (First Approach)**

The most efficient solution is the **first approach** (two-pass with index tracking) because it is the simplest, operates in **O(n)** time complexity, and **O(1)** space complexity.

Here’s a recap of that approach:

### **Optimal Solution (First Approach)**:

```javascript
function moveZeros(list) {
  let index = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    if (list[i] != 0) {
      list[index++] = list[i]; // Shift non-zero elements to the front
    }
  }
  for (let i = index; i < list.length; i++) {
    list[i] = 0; // Fill the rest of the list with zeros
  }
  return list;
}
```

- **Explanation**: It iterates through the list twice: once to move all non-zero values to the beginning, and once to fill in the zeros after the last non-zero element.
- **Why Optimal**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n), because we only pass through the list twice.
  - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the list is modified in place without using extra space.
  - **Simplicity**: The logic is straightforward and easy to understand.

### **Conclusion**

The first solution (two-pass approach) is the most efficient in terms of both time and space. While other approaches like using `sort()` or manual swapping with `while` loops might seem appealing in certain situations, they come with drawbacks in terms of performance or complexity. For this problem, sticking to the two-pass approach is the best choice.
