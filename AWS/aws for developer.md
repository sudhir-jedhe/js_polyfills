// ii. API Gateway will help secure API resources with fine-grained access management such as authorisation, API versioning, etc.
// iii. Lambda can also be used to customise the delivery of content.

// 5. AWS App Sync
// i. It is essential to work with GraphQL APIs for real-time data queries, etc.

// b. Deployment & Delivery

// 1. AWS Codebuild

As a frontend and mobile developer, you already have a great foundation with AWS services. If you'd like to add more, here are a few additional services you might find helpful:

1. **AWS Step Functions**  
   - Orchestrate serverless workflows. You can use it to chain Lambda functions and other services into sophisticated workflows.

2. **Amazon DynamoDB**  
   - A fully managed NoSQL database service that is serverless, highly scalable, and fast. It's a great choice for storing data for your apps.

3. **Amazon API Gateway**  
   - For creating and managing APIs, especially if you're using RESTful services or need fine-grained control over your API.

4. **AWS App Runner**  
   - An easy way to deploy containerized applications in production with minimal configuration. This can be particularly useful for deploying APIs or backend services.

5. **AWS X-Ray**  
   - Helps with monitoring and debugging applications, especially in serverless environments, by providing insights into how requests travel through your services.

6. **Amazon Pinpoint**  
   - Use this for mobile app analytics, push notifications, and user engagement.

These services could enhance your app-building experience by providing more control over your workflows, monitoring, and engagement strategies. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any of them!
