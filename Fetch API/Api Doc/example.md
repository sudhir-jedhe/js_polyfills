I'll implement these 10 best practices for API design using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. We'll create a comprehensive example that demonstrates all these practices.

Let's start with the backend implementation:

```typescriptreact project="BookLibraryAPI"
...
```

This implementation covers all 10 best practices for API design:

1. API versioning: We use URL segments (/api/v1) for versioning.
2. HTTP status codes: We use appropriate status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500) for different scenarios.
3. Error handling: We have a custom error handler middleware that provides informative error messages.
4. Data validation: We use express-validator to validate input data.
5. Security: We implement authentication using JWT and authorization using role-based access control.
6. Pagination: We implement pagination for the GET /books endpoint.
7. Filtering: We allow filtering books by author.
8. Caching: We use node-cache to implement caching for GET requests.
9. Documentation: We use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
10. Meaningful responses: Our API provides clear and consistent responses for all endpoints.


To run this project:

1. In the backend directory:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Create a `.env` file and add `JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here`
3. Run `npm start` to start the server



2. In the frontend directory:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start the React application





You can access the Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` when the server is running.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a RESTful API following best practices, with a simple React frontend to demonstrate its usage.
