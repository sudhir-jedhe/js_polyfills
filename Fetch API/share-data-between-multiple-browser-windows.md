// We have already seen how we can share data between two browser windows (tabs) that are on the same domain with JavaScript. In this article, we will see how we can share data between multiple browser windows.

// Unlike sharing data between two windows, where we pass data to the windows using the Window.postMessage(), for multiple windows, we cannot determine who has opened which windows, thus rather than passing the data in chain, we will use a centralized solution.

// We will store the data in the localstorage and use the Window.onStorage() to listen to the event.

// The Window.onStorage() event is fired whenever there is modification on the localStorage and the event will be triggered in each window, except for the window that does the modification.

// Using this we can pass data around multiple windows. Let us see an example of it.

// Create three HTML files with the scripts.

// home
// login
// about
// home.html will have a button that will open login.html and login.html will have a button that will open about.html.

// Inside about.html we will store data in localStorage and check after the action, if the event is fired on the home.html and about.html.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <h1>Hello, this is the Home page.</h1>
    <button onclick="openLogin()">Open Login</button>
    <script>
      let loginWindow;
      const openLogin = () => {
        loginWindow = window.open("login.html", "_blank");
      };

      window.addEventListener("storage", (event) => {
        console.log("Got storage data in home");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

    <h1>Hello, this is the login page.</h1>
    <button onclick="openAbout()">open About</button>
    <script>
      let aboutWindow;

      const openAbout = () => {
        aboutWindow = window.open("about.html", "_blank");
      };

      window.addEventListener("storage", (event) => {
        console.log("Got storage data in login");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>



<!DOCTYPE html>

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, this is the About page.</h1>
    <button onclick="sendMsgToAll()">Send message to All</button>
    <script>
      const sendMsgToAll = () => {
        localStorage.removeItem("data");
        localStorage.setItem("data", "Hello From About");
      };

      window.addEventListener("storage", (event) => {
        console.log("I won't log");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>


Now open the home page in any browser and click on the button and open the login as well as about page.

On the about page, click the button Send Message to All and you will see the messaged logged in the console of the home and login page.


This example demonstrates an elegant way to share data between multiple browser windows using `localStorage` and the `storage` event. Hereâ€™s a summary and key points about the implementation:

---

### Key Concepts:
1. **Centralized Data Storage:**
   - The shared data is stored in `localStorage`, which is accessible across all windows of the same origin.

2. **Event Propagation via `storage` Event:**
   - When data in `localStorage` is updated, the `storage` event is triggered in all windows except the one performing the update.

3. **Cross-Window Communication:**
   - Windows communicate by listening for the `storage` event and reacting to changes in `localStorage`.

4. **Multiple Windows Setup:**
   - `home.html` opens `login.html`.
   - `login.html` opens `about.html`.
   - Any window can update shared data using `localStorage`.

---

### How It Works:
1. **`home.html`:**
   - Opens the `login.html` window.
   - Listens for the `storage` event and logs any changes in `localStorage`.

2. **`login.html`:**
   - Opens the `about.html` window.
   - Also listens for the `storage` event to capture shared data changes.

3. **`about.html`:**
   - Updates the `localStorage` data using the `sendMsgToAll` function.
   - Triggers the `storage` event in other windows (`home` and `login`), allowing them to receive the updated data.

---

### Observations:
- The window performing the update (`about.html`) does not trigger its own `storage` event listener. This is a known behavior of the `storage` event.
- The approach is domain-restricted; all pages must be on the same domain to share `localStorage`.

---

### Enhancements:
- **Data Structure:**
  - Store structured data (e.g., JSON objects) in `localStorage` for better extensibility.
- **Validation:**
  - Validate the `event` object in the `storage` event listener to ensure the updated key is the one of interest.

```javascript
window.addEventListener("storage", (event) => {
  if (event.key === "data") {
    console.log(`Received data: ${event.newValue}`);
  }
});
```

- **Cleanup:**
  - Use `localStorage.removeItem` to remove outdated data when it's no longer needed.

---

This technique is simple, effective, and works well for lightweight inter-window communication. If you need more robust solutions for sharing data across domains or with higher security, consider WebSockets or server-side solutions.
