=The code you've provided implements a solution for searching an element (`target`) in a rotated sorted array, and it does so with a time complexity of O(log n), which meets the problem's requirement. Let's break down how the algorithm works and its logic.

### Problem Recap:
Given a rotated sorted array and a target value, we need to find the index of the target using an O(log n) approach. The array was originally sorted but might have been rotated at an unknown pivot.

### Key Insights:
1. **Binary Search**: The core idea is to leverage binary search, as it provides a time complexity of O(log n). However, the array isn't simply sortedâ€”it has been rotated.
2. **Identifying Sorted Half**: In any rotation, one half of the array will be sorted, while the other half will be unsorted. By checking the left and right halves of the array, we can decide which half to discard in order to narrow down the search.
3. **Conditions to Adjust Search Range**: 
   - If the left half is sorted, we check if the target lies within this range.
   - If not, we check if the right half is sorted, and similarly adjust the search range.

### Code Walkthrough:

```javascript
function search(nums, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        // If the target is found at the middle element
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        }

        // Check if the left half is sorted (based on the first and middle elements)
        if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
            // If the target is within the sorted left half
            if (target >= nums[left] && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                // Search in the unsorted right half
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        } else {
            // Check if the right half is sorted (based on the middle and last elements)
            if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Search in the unsorted left half
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }

    // Target not found
    return -1;
}
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Initialize pointers**:
   - `left` starts at the beginning of the array (`0`).
   - `right` starts at the end of the array (`nums.length - 1`).

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - While `left <= right`, we calculate the middle index: `mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)`.
   - If `nums[mid] === target`, we immediately return the index `mid` as the target is found.

3. **Check for Sorted Half**:
   - If the left half is sorted (i.e., `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`):
     - If the target lies within the range of the sorted half (`nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]`), move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
     - If the target doesn't lie in the sorted left half, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
   - If the right half is sorted (i.e., `nums[mid] < nums[right]`):
     - If the target lies within the range of the sorted right half (`nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]`), move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
     - Otherwise, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.

4. **If the target is not found**:
   - If we exit the loop (i.e., `left > right`), it means the target is not present in the array, and we return `-1`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```javascript
console.log(search([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], 0)); // Output: 4
```

1. The array is `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, rotated at index `3`.
2. Target is `0`, and we perform binary search:
   - Initially, `left = 0` and `right = 6`.
   - `mid = 3` (`nums[mid] = 7`).
   - Since `nums[left] = 4 <= nums[mid] = 7`, the left half is sorted. Since `0` is not in the range `[4, 7]`, we search the right half by setting `left = mid + 1 = 4`.
   - Now, `left = 4`, `right = 6`. `mid = 5` (`nums[mid] = 1`).
   - The left half `[0, 1]` is sorted. Since `0` is in the range `[0, 1]`, we search the left half by setting `right = mid - 1 = 4`.
   - Finally, `left = 4`, `right = 4`, `mid = 4` (`nums[mid] = 0`), and we find the target at index `4`.

#### Example 2:
```javascript
console.log(search([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], 3)); // Output: -1
```

1. The target `3` is not in the array, so after running the binary search, the result is `-1`.

#### Example 3:
```javascript
console.log(search([1], 0)); // Output: -1
```

1. The target `0` is not in the array, so the result is `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- If the array has only one element, the algorithm will correctly return the index if the target matches or `-1` if it doesn't.
- The algorithm works efficiently even when the array is not rotated (i.e., no pivot).

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n). This is due to the binary search approach, where in each iteration we halve the search space.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We only use a constant amount of extra space for the variables `left`, `right`, and `mid`.

### Conclusion:
This solution effectively and efficiently solves the problem by using binary search and leveraging the properties of a rotated sorted array. It ensures a logarithmic time complexity, which is optimal for this problem.
