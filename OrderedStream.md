The code you provided is an implementation of an `OrderedStream` class that maintains the order of inserted values in a stream. Let's walk through the behavior of this class and the methods you implemented.

### Class Overview:

The `OrderedStream` class is designed to insert values at specific positions (denoted by `idKey`) and returns the values from the current pointer position onward, as long as they are consecutive.

### Constructor:
- `constructor(n)`: This initializes the stream with a length of `n + 1` (to accommodate 1-based indexing). The `ptr` is set to 1, which will keep track of the next position to check in the stream.

### Method: `insert(idKey, value)`
- This method inserts a `value` at the position `idKey` in the stream array.
- After inserting the value, it checks whether the current position (pointed to by `ptr`) has a valid value.
- If the value at the current position exists, it adds that value to the result and moves the pointer (`ptr`) to the next position.

### The Flow:

1. **First Insert (idKey = 3, value = "ccccc")**:
   - The value is inserted at index 3, but no earlier values are inserted yet. The pointer (`ptr`) is still at position 1, but the array doesn't have any values at that point.
   - **Output**: `[]` (nothing returned, because no value is present at `ptr`).

2. **Second Insert (idKey = 1, value = "aaaaa")**:
   - Now, value `"aaaaa"` is inserted at position 1.
   - The pointer (`ptr`) is at 1, and the value at position 1 is `"aaaaa"`. This matches the pointer, so it is returned.
   - **Output**: `["aaaaa"]`.

3. **Third Insert (idKey = 2, value = "bbbbb")**:
   - Now, value `"bbbbb"` is inserted at position 2.
   - The pointer is at position 2, and both position 1 and 2 have values (`"aaaaa"` and `"bbbbb"`, respectively).
   - Both `"bbbbb"` and `"ccccc"` (which was previously inserted at index 3) are returned because they are now consecutive starting from the pointer.
   - **Output**: `["bbbbb", "ccccc"]`.

4. **Fourth Insert (idKey = 5, value = "eeeee")**:
   - This inserts `"eeeee"` at position 5. But the pointer is still at position 4.
   - **Output**: `[]` (no values to return because the pointer is at position 4 and the value at 4 is still missing).

5. **Fifth Insert (idKey = 4, value = "ddddd")**:
   - Now, `"ddddd"` is inserted at position 4.
   - The pointer now advances because all positions from 1 to 4 are filled consecutively.
   - It returns the values from the pointer position (which is now 4) onward.
   - **Output**: `["ddddd", "eeeee"]`.

### Complete Execution:

```javascript
const os = new OrderedStream(5); // Create an OrderedStream with capacity 5

console.log(os.insert(3, "ccccc")); // Output: []
console.log(os.insert(1, "aaaaa")); // Output: ["aaaaa"]
console.log(os.insert(2, "bbbbb")); // Output: ["bbbbb", "ccccc"]
console.log(os.insert(5, "eeeee")); // Output: []
console.log(os.insert(4, "ddddd")); // Output: ["ddddd", "eeeee"]
```

### Final Explanation:
1. The `OrderedStream` works based on a pointer (`ptr`), which always points to the next smallest `idKey` that should have a value. The stream is built incrementally.
2. When a value is inserted, if the stream from the pointer onward is filled with consecutive values, it returns all of them.
3. This behavior ensures that only consecutive values (starting from the lowest `idKey`) are returned.

This is a correct implementation of the problem, and it handles the requirements as expected.
