The `ascendingSequence` function you've written generates an array of integers starting from a given `start` number and ending at the `end` number, inclusively.

### Code Explanation:

```javascript
function ascendingSequence(start, end) {
  // Create an empty array to store the sequence.
  const sequence = [];

  // Iterate from the start number to the end number, adding each number to the sequence.
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    sequence.push(i);  // Adds each number to the array 'sequence'
  }

  // Return the sequence.
  return sequence;
}
```

- **Parameters**: The function takes two parameters:
  - `start`: The first number in the sequence.
  - `end`: The last number in the sequence.

- **Process**: 
  - It initializes an empty array `sequence`.
  - Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate from `start` to `end` (inclusive). For each iteration, it pushes the current number (`i`) into the `sequence` array.

- **Return**: After the loop completes, the function returns the `sequence` array, which contains all integers from `start` to `end`.

### Example Usage:

```javascript
const sequence1 = ascendingSequence(1, 10);
console.log(sequence1);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

const sequence2 = ascendingSequence(5, 8);
console.log(sequence2);  // Output: [5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### Output for the given example:

```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

### Why this works:
- The `for` loop starts at the `start` value and runs until `i <= end` (inclusive), meaning the `end` value is included in the sequence.
- The `sequence.push(i)` line adds each number from `start` to `end` to the array.
  
### Potential Improvements/Considerations:
- You might want to handle edge cases, such as when `start` is greater than `end`, to ensure the function works as expected in those scenarios. Right now, if `start > end`, the function will return an empty array.
  
### Improved Version to Handle Edge Cases:
```javascript
function ascendingSequence(start, end) {
  if (start > end) {
    return []; // Return an empty array if start is greater than end
  }

  const sequence = [];
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    sequence.push(i);
  }
  return sequence;
}
```

This version will return an empty array when the start value is greater than the end value, preventing unexpected behavior.
