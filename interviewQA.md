  - **ARIA Roles & Accessibility Standards:** Talk about following **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** and using **ARIA** roles to make your application accessible to screen readers.
  - **Keyboard Navigation & Focus Management:** Explain how you handle focus management and ensure the application is navigable with a keyboard.
  - **Testing for Accessibility:** Discuss tools like **Lighthouse**, **axe-core**, or **react-axe** to audit and ensure accessibility compliance.

#### **2. Advanced React Questions**
These questions test your depth of understanding of React and its advanced concepts.

- **Explain the concept of React’s Virtual DOM and how it works.**
  - Discuss how React uses the **Virtual DOM** to minimize direct manipulation of the real DOM, thus improving performance. Explain the **reconciliation** process and **diffing algorithm** used by React to detect and update only the changed parts of the DOM.

- **What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled component? When would you use one over the other?**
  - **Controlled Components:** In controlled components, the form data is managed by React state. Use controlled components when you need to validate, manage, or modify the input.
  - **Uncontrolled Components:** In uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself. Use this when you don’t need to control the form state and want better performance for large forms.

- **Explain React’s Context API and when it is appropriate to use it.**
  - Discuss the use of **Context API** for sharing global state without passing props down manually. Mention performance concerns and how it might lead to unnecessary re-renders in large applications. Compare it to **Redux** and discuss when it’s better to use one over the other.

- **What is React Suspense, and how does it relate to data fetching?**
  - Discuss **React Suspense** as a way to handle asynchronous loading of data, enabling seamless rendering of loading states. Also, mention how **React Concurrent Mode** improves app performance by allowing React to pause work and continue later without blocking the main thread.

- **How would you handle component state and side effects in a large-scale application?**
  - **State Management Libraries:** Use **Redux** or **React Query** for managing large-scale state and caching server-side data.
  - **Side Effects Management:** Explain your approach to handling side effects using **React hooks** like `useEffect` and middleware like **redux-thunk** or **redux-saga** for async operations.

- **What is the significance of React hooks, and how do they improve the React ecosystem?**
  - Discuss how **hooks** make it easier to share stateful logic across components. Explain the benefits of **useState**, **useEffect**, **useContext**, and custom hooks. Compare hooks to class components and their advantages (e.g., cleaner syntax, easier to test).

#### **3. Leadership / Managerial Questions**
These questions focus on your experience managing teams, mentoring, and fostering collaboration.

- **How do you prioritize tasks and projects in a fast-paced development environment?**
