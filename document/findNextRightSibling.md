```js
function findNextRightSibling(root, target) {
    if (!root || !target) return null; // Return null if root or target is null or undefined

    const queue = [root]; // Initialize queue with root node
    let foundTarget = false;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelSize = queue.length;

        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const currentNode = queue.shift(); // Dequeue node from front of queue

            if (foundTarget && i > 0) {
                return currentNode; // Return the next right sibling if target has been found and it's not the first node in the level
            }

            if (currentNode === target) {
                foundTarget = true; // Set flag to indicate that target has been found
            }

            // Enqueue children of the current node
            if (currentNode.left) queue.push(currentNode.left);
            if (currentNode.right) queue.push(currentNode.right);
        }
    }

    return null; // Return null if target node is not found or it's the last node in its level
}

// Example usage:
// Assuming `root` is the reference to the root node of the binary tree
// Assuming `target` is the reference to the target node whose right sibling is to be found
// const rightSibling = findNextRightSibling(root, target);
// console.log(rightSibling);


```

The code you've shared is a solution to finding the next right sibling of a target node in a **binary tree**. The approach is based on **level-order traversal** using a **queue**, where each level of the tree is processed one by one, and we look for the target node within a level. Once we find the target node, we can then return the next node in the level, which will be its right sibling.

Let's break down the solution and explain it clearly:

### Solution Explanation:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - If the `root` or `target` is `null`, return `null` immediately because there's no sibling to find.

2. **Queue Initialization:**
   - A **queue** is initialized with the root node to start a **level-order traversal** (also known as **BFS** - Breadth-First Search).

3. **Level-wise Traversal:**
   - At each level of the tree, all nodes at that level are processed before moving to the next level. This is done by iterating over the current level's nodes (using `levelSize` to track how many nodes are at that level).

4. **Target Node Search:**
   - We maintain a flag (`foundTarget`) to indicate if we've encountered the `target` node. Once the `target` is found, we check if it's the first node of that level (in which case, it doesn't have a right sibling).
   - If it's not the first node in the level (i.e., it's the second or later node), we return the **current node**, which will be the right sibling of the target.

5. **Enqueue Children:**
   - For each node, if it has left and right children, we add them to the queue to be processed in the next level.

6. **Return `null`:**
   - If we finish traversing the tree and can't find a right sibling, return `null`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we are visiting each node once in a level-order traversal.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes at the largest level of the tree (which could be the width of the tree). This space is used by the queue during the traversal.

### Example Usage:

Here's a demonstration of the code with a binary tree example:

```javascript
// Definition of a binary tree node
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

// Example Binary Tree
//         1
//       /   \
//      2     3
//     / \   / \
//    4   5 6   7

const root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(6);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(7);

// Find the next right sibling of node with value 5
const target = root.left.right; // Target is node with value 5
const rightSibling = findNextRightSibling(root, target);

console.log(rightSibling ? rightSibling.val : null); // Output: 6 (right sibling of 5)
```

### How It Works:

1. **Tree Structure:**

   ```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   / \
  4   5 6   7
   ```

2. **Finding the Right Sibling:**

   - We start at the root node (1).
   - In the first level, we find nodes 1, which has no right sibling.
   - In the second level, we find nodes 2 and 3. The right sibling of 2 is 3, but we're searching for the sibling of 5, so we move to the next level.
   - In the third level, we find nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. The right sibling of 5 is 6, so we return node 6.

### Edge Cases:

- **No Sibling:** If the target is the last node in its level, the function will return `null`.
- **No Target:** If the target node doesn't exist in the tree, the function will also return `null`.
- **Empty Tree:** If the root is `null`, it will immediately return `null`.

### Conclusion:
This solution effectively uses **level-order traversal** to identify the next right sibling of a target node in a binary tree. It's a simple yet efficient way to solve the problem using a **queue** for traversal.
