### Problem Description

The goal is to traverse a DOM tree **level by level** (breadth-first search) and return an array where each element is an array of nodes at that particular level. This means the first array in the result should contain all the nodes at the root level, the second array should contain the nodes at the next level, and so on.

### Code Explanation

The `traverseDOMLevelByLevel` function implements a **breadth-first traversal** (BFS) of the DOM tree. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

### Key Steps:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Initialize the `result` array to store the nodes level by level.
   - If the `root` is `null`, return an empty array immediately.
   - Initialize the `queue` with the `root` node.

2. **Breadth-First Traversal**:
   - While there are still nodes in the `queue` (i.e., the traversal hasn't reached the bottom of the tree):
     - Determine how many nodes are on the current level by checking the `queue` length (`levelSize`).
     - Create an empty array `levelNodes` to store the nodes at the current level.
     - For each node in the current level:
       - Remove the first node from the `queue` (i.e., dequeue).
       - Add the node to the `levelNodes` array.
       - Enqueue all the children of the current node (if any).

3. **Result Construction**:
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, push the `levelNodes` array into the `result` array.

4. **Return**:
   - Once the `queue` is empty (all nodes are processed), return the `result` array.

### Final Code:

```javascript
function traverseDOMLevelByLevel(root) {
    const result = [];
    if (!root) return result; // Return empty array if root is null or undefined

    const queue = [root]; // Initialize queue with root node

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelSize = queue.length; // Get the number of nodes at the current level
        const levelNodes = []; // Array to hold the nodes at this level

        // Process each node at the current level
        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const node = queue.shift(); // Dequeue node from front of queue
            levelNodes.push(node); // Add node to the current level array

            // Enqueue children of the current node
            if (node.children) {
                for (const child of node.children) {
                    queue.push(child);
                }
            }
        }

        result.push(levelNodes); // Add the current level array to the result
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Example Usage:

To use this function, you can call `traverseDOMLevelByLevel` on a DOM tree, starting from a `root` element:

```javascript
const root = document.getElementById('root'); // Assuming there's an element with ID 'root'
const result = traverseDOMLevelByLevel(root);

console.log(result);  // Outputs an array of arrays, each representing a level in the DOM tree
```

### Output Structure:

If you have the following DOM structure:

```html
<div id="root">
  <div>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
  </div>
  <span>Span 1</span>
</div>
```

The output of `traverseDOMLevelByLevel(root)` will be:

```javascript
[
  [<div id="root">], // First level: only the root node
  [<div>, <span>],   // Second level: children of the root node
  [<p>, <p>]          // Third level: children of the div node
]
```

### Explanation of Output:

- The first level contains only the root element (`<div id="root">`).
- The second level contains the direct children of the root (`<div>` and `<span>`).
- The third level contains the children of the `<div>` node (`<p>` tags).

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the DOM tree. This is because each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)** for storing the result and the queue. The space used by the queue at any point is proportional to the number of nodes at the current level (in the worst case, all nodes could be at the same level).

### Conclusion:

This implementation effectively performs a breadth-first traversal of the DOM, processing nodes level by level, and storing them in an array structure that reflects this order. This approach can be useful when you need to process or inspect nodes in a DOM tree layer by layer.
