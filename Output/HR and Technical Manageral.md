InterviewThis is an open source list of developer questions to ask prospective employers during the hiring process.  I created this list because, frankly, the existing lists that I saw on this topic really sucked.  Many of the starting questions came about from years of hiring into jobs only to find out about some lousy attribute of the company which, had I known about, I probably wouldn't have accepted. Since I began this list I've received many additional contributions from other developers.

This is not a checklist, this is not a shopping list. If you send this entire list to an employer, they probably won't be calling you back. **This list is intended to serve as a reference point for things to be aware of during your interview process.** Not all of these questions will be relevant to every person or position, you should choose the ones that are relevant to you and what you are interviewing for.  It's OK for there to be questions on this list that you personally do not care about.

The questions on this list are not all appropriate for the initial interview, many could not even be answered by the HR person likely to conduct an initial interview. This list is intended to be a comprehensive collection of things a developer may want to know about a company before they accept an offer.

Use your discretion when choosing what questions to ask and when to ask them.

### Contributing

Pull requests and Issues are very welcomed and encouraged, but please don't get offended if I reject your question or do not merge your question verbatim. I may ask that you reword it to be clearer, or may even rewrite it myself.

Front End Developer Employer Questions
=======================================

The Front-end Job Interview Questions list (https://github.com/darcyclarke/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) is pretty awesome--if you're an employer. It gave me the idea to have a list of questions for front-end developers to ask prospective employers.

These questions cover employers who are large enough to have a dedicated development team. It should work reasonably well for both agencies and companies that are working on internal projects.

Interviews usually happen with both Managers and Team Members, so I've split the questions into those two general categories.
