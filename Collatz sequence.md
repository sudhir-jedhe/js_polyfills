The Collatz sequence is a fascinating sequence that begins with any positive integer and proceeds by applying the following rules until the number becomes 1:

- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and then add 1.

The sequence ends when the number reaches 1.

### Explanation of the Two Versions of Collatz

You've implemented **two versions** of the Collatz sequence:

1. **Iterative Version** (`collatz`):
   - This version uses a `while` loop to continuously apply the Collatz operations until the number reaches 1.
   - At each step, the number is printed, and the sequence is updated based on whether the number is even or odd.
   - The loop runs until `num` equals 1, and the final number (1) is printed at the end.

2. **Tail Recursive Version** (`collatzTail`):
   - This version uses **tail recursion** to achieve the same result as the iterative version, but the logic is expressed in a recursive manner.
   - Instead of using a loop, it calls itself with the updated number (`num / 2` for even numbers, or `3 * num + 1` for odd numbers).
   - A `store` array is passed along to store the sequence of numbers as the recursion proceeds.

### Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of each function:

#### 1. Iterative Collatz Sequence (`collatz`):
```javascript
let collatz = (num) => {
    // Loop until the given num is not 1
    while (num != 1) {
        console.log(num); // Print the current number
        
        // If the number is even
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            num = parseInt(num / 2);  // Divide by 2 for even numbers
        } else {
            // If the number is odd
            num = (num * 3) + 1;  // Multiply by 3 and add 1 for odd numbers
        }
    }

    // Print the last number (1)
    console.log(num);
};
```

#### Example:
```javascript
collatz(6);
// Output: 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
```

#### 2. Tail Recursive Collatz Sequence (`collatzTail`):
```javascript
let collatzTail = (num, store = []) => {
    // If num is 1, add it to the store array and return
    if (num === 1) { 
        store.push(1);
        return store;
    }
    
    // If num is even, store num / 2 and recurse
    else if (num % 2 === 0) {
        store.push(num);
        return collatzTail(parseInt(num / 2), store);
    }
    // If num is odd, store num * 3 + 1 and recurse
    else {
        store.push(num);
        return collatzTail(3 * num + 1, store);
    }
};
```

#### Example:
```javascript
console.log(collatzTail(6));
// Output: [6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
```

### Differences Between the Two Versions:

1. **Iteration vs Recursion**:
   - The **iterative version** uses a loop (`while`), which is the standard and efficient approach for tasks like the Collatz sequence.
   - The **recursive version** uses a function that calls itself, and this technique is known as **tail recursion**. It's not as efficient as the iterative approach for larger numbers due to the stack frame overhead but is often used to showcase recursive patterns.

2. **State Management**:
   - In the **iterative version**, the sequence of numbers is printed directly at each step.
   - In the **recursive version**, the numbers are stored in the `store` array and returned as the result at the end of recursion.

3. **Termination**:
   - Both versions stop when the number reaches `1`, but the iterative version prints the numbers in the process, while the recursive version builds a list of the numbers and returns it.

### Conclusion:
Both implementations are correct and give you the Collatz sequence for any starting number. The iterative version is more straightforward, while the tail-recursive version might be preferred in situations where recursion is the favored style or for functional programming enthusiasts. 

However, for large numbers, **iteration** tends to be more efficient in JavaScript due to the function call stack limit and the potential for stack overflow errors with deep recursion.
