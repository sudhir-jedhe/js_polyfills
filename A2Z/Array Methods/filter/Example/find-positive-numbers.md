The code filters out all positive numbers from the `nums` array using the `filter` method and logs the resulting array to the console. Here's how it works:

### **Code Explanation**
```javascript
let nums = [4, -5, 3, 2, -1, 7, -6, 8, 9];

// Using the filter method to extract positive numbers
let pos_nums = nums.filter((e) => e > 0);

// Logging the result
console.log(pos_nums);
```

1. **Input Array (`nums`)**:
   - Contains a mix of positive and negative integers: `[4, -5, 3, 2, -1, 7, -6, 8, 9]`.

2. **`filter` Method**:
   - Iterates over each element in the `nums` array.
   - Checks if the element `e` is greater than `0`.
   - If the condition is `true`, the element is included in the new array.

3. **Result (`pos_nums`)**:
   - Only positive numbers from the `nums` array are included.

4. **Output**:
   - The resulting array of positive numbers is logged to the console.

### **Output**
```javascript
[4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 9]
```

This implementation is efficient and concise for filtering positive numbers from an array.
