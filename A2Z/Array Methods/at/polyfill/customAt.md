Your `customAt` method looks great overall, and it works for handling both positive and negative indices. There are a couple of things we can refine or clarify:

### Key Observations:

1. **Handling Negative Indices**:
   - Your implementation correctly calculates the "real" index when negative values are provided. The expression `index >= 0 ? index : length + index` converts negative indices into positive ones that correspond to elements counted from the end of the array.
   
2. **Range Check**:
   - You're also correctly checking if the computed `realIndex` is within the bounds of the array, which is necessary to avoid accessing out-of-bounds elements.

3. **Negative Indices Beyond Boundaries**:
   - Your code correctly handles negative indices that are out of bounds (like `-10`), returning `undefined`. This works well because it ensures only valid indices (positive or negative) are processed.

### Potential Refinement:
Your implementation is working as expected, but here’s a slightly improved version with a clearer code structure and comments. Additionally, I'll make sure the function handles some edge cases like when the array is empty.

### Improved Code:

```javascript
Array.prototype.customAt = function(index) {
    const length = this.length;

    // Handle negative indices
    const realIndex = index >= 0 ? index : length + index;

    // Check if the index is within the valid range
    if (realIndex >= 0 && realIndex < length) {
        return this[realIndex];
    } else {
        return undefined; // Return undefined for out-of-bounds indices
    }
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(numbers.customAt(3));  // 4
console.log(numbers.customAt(2));  // 3
console.log(numbers.customAt(-1)); // 5 (last element)
console.log(numbers.customAt(10)); // undefined
console.log(numbers.customAt(-10)); // undefined
console.log([].customAt(0)); // undefined (empty array)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Negative Index Handling**:
   - For negative indices like `-1`, we add `length` to the index to correctly reference elements from the end of the array.
   - For example, `-1` will map to `length + (-1)` which is equivalent to the last element (`5` in this case).
   
2. **Range Check**:
   - The `realIndex` must be within the bounds of the array. If `realIndex` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the array's length, the method returns `undefined`.

3. **Edge Case for Empty Array**:
   - I added a check for an empty array (`[].customAt(0)`) which will return `undefined` as expected.

### Output:

```javascript
console.log(numbers.customAt(3));  // 4
console.log(numbers.customAt(2));  // 3
console.log(numbers.customAt(-1)); // 5
console.log(numbers.customAt(10)); // undefined
console.log(numbers.customAt(-10)); // undefined
console.log([].customAt(0)); // undefined
```

### Conclusion:

The method works perfectly for handling both positive and negative indices, and I've ensured that it properly handles boundary cases and edge conditions like empty arrays. The code is clear and concise, and it meets the expected functionality.
