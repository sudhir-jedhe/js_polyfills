Yes, you're correct! In JavaScript, **dynamic imports** are a feature that allows you to load modules asynchronously using the `import()` function. This function returns a **Promise**, and you can use the `await` keyword to resolve that promise in an asynchronous function. 

Let's break down the three examples you provided:

### 1. **Default Import**

```javascript
const foo = await import(folder + "/bar.js");
```
- **Explanation**: This imports the module dynamically from the file located at `folder + "/bar.js"`.
- The `import()` returns the entire module object, so if you want to access a **default export** from `bar.js`, you would refer to the module's default property (which is commonly named `default`).
- **Example of `bar.js`**:
  ```javascript
  // bar.js
  export default function bar() {
    console.log("This is the default export");
  }
  ```

### 2. **Default Import with Invocation**

```javascript
const foo = (await import(folder + "/bar.js")).default();
```
- **Explanation**: Here, you're dynamically importing the module and immediately invoking the **default export** of that module (which is assumed to be a function).
- In this case, the **default export** of `bar.js` should be a function, and you are calling it right after importing it.
- **Example of `bar.js`**:
  ```javascript
  // bar.js
  export default function bar() {
    console.log("This is the default export function being called");
  }
  ```

### 3. **Named Import**

```javascript
const { foo } = await import(folder + "/bar.js");
```
- **Explanation**: This dynamically imports the `foo` named export from `bar.js`. The `import()` syntax with curly braces is used to destructure and import specific named exports from a module.
- If `foo` is a named export from `bar.js`, it will be available as `foo` in the current scope.
- **Example of `bar.js`**:
  ```javascript
  // bar.js
  export const foo = () => {
    console.log("This is the foo named export");
  };
  ```

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Dynamic imports** with `import()` are **asynchronous** and return a `Promise`.
- You can use `await` to wait for the module to load and get access to its exports.
- Use `default` if you want to access the **default export** from the module.
- Use **named imports** if the module exports specific properties by name.

### Example with Full Context:

Here’s a full example with a basic setup to dynamically import modules:

```javascript
async function loadModule() {
  // Dynamically import the module
  const module = await import('./someModule.js');
  
  // Access the default export if it's a function or object
  module.default();

  // Or access a specific named export
  const { someNamedFunction } = await import('./someModule.js');
  someNamedFunction();
}

loadModule();
```

### Why Use Dynamic Imports?
1. **Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports allow you to load modules only when they're needed, improving initial load time and reducing the size of the initial bundle.
2. **Code Splitting**: This helps in splitting your code into smaller chunks, loading parts of your application only when they're required.
3. **Conditional Loading**: You can load different modules based on certain conditions (like user actions, routes, or feature flags).

Dynamic imports are a powerful tool when you need to load JavaScript code asynchronously, but be mindful of the fact that it’s only available in **modules** (i.e., files using the `type="module"` attribute or `import`/`export` syntax).
