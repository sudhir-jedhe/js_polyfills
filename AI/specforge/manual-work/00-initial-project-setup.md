# Manual Work 00 — Initial Project Setup

## Already completed manually

- Created the root project folder: `SPECFORGE/`
- Created the frontend app inside `client/`
- Installed shadcn/ui inside `client/`
- Installed and selected the shadcn theme
- Created the backend folder: `server/`
- Ran `npm init -y` inside `server/`
- Created `server/tsconfig.json`
- Created an empty `server/src/` folder
- Created root-level empty `docker-compose.yml`
- Added the Cursor system pack:
  - `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `context/tracker.md`
  - `manual-work/00-initial-project-setup.md`
  - `prompts/01-project-foundation.md`
  - `specs/01-project-foundation.md`

## Cursor must assume

The project already exists. Cursor should not recreate the Next.js project, reinstall shadcn/ui, or move the frontend/backend folders.
