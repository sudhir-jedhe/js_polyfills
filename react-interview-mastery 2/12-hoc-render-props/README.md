# HOCs & Render Props

Before hooks existed, higher-order components (HOCs) and render props were the two standard patterns for sharing stateful logic between components — both still show up in older codebases and some libraries, so recognizing and reading them is a practical skill even though you'll rarely write new ones. This topic walks through a full `withLoading` HOC and an equivalent render-props component side by side, explains precisely why hooks superseded both (composability without wrapper hell, no prop-naming collisions between multiple enhancers), and identifies the narrow cases — mostly third-party library integration — where a HOC is still the right tool today.

## What's covered
- Higher-order components: definition, a full `withLoading` example
- Render props pattern: a full worked example
- Why hooks replaced both patterns (composability, wrapper hell, naming collisions)
- Remaining legitimate use cases for HOCs today

## Structure

- `theory/` — concept write-ups: HOCs, render props, why hooks replaced both, HOC vs render props vs hooks comparisons, when a HOC is still the right call
- `snippets/` — one focused code example per file
- `output-based/` — "what does this log/render" questions with answers
- `scenarios/` — realistic debugging/design scenarios with worked approaches
- `interview-qa/` — Q&A grouped by theme (fundamentals, implementation/typing, modern usage & trade-offs)
- `problems/` — worked problems: a `withLoading` HOC, the equivalent render-prop version side by side, and a `withErrorBoundary` HOC (cross-references `13-error-boundaries`)
- `assets/` — placeholder for original notes' images/PDFs
