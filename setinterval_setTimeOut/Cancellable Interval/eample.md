Let's create a React component to demonstrate the `customSetInterval` function:

```typescriptreact project="CustomSetIntervalDemo"
...
```

This implementation demonstrates the `customSetInterval` function in a React component. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

1. **Custom setInterval Function**: The `customSetInterval` function is implemented as provided. It uses `setTimeout` to create a repeating interval and returns a cancellation function.
2. **React Component**: The `CustomSetIntervalDemo` component provides a user interface to start and stop the interval, and displays the logs of the interval ticks.
3. **State Management**:

1. `logs` state keeps track of all the messages logged by the interval.
2. `isRunning` state indicates whether the interval is currently active.
3. `cancelIntervalRef` is a ref that holds the cancellation function returned by `customSetInterval`.



4. **Interval Control**:

1. `startInterval` function initiates the interval, incrementing a counter and logging each tick.
2. `stopInterval` function cancels the interval using the cancellation function stored in `cancelIntervalRef`.



5. **User Interface**:

1. Two buttons allow users to start and stop the interval.
2. A scrollable area displays all the logged messages, including timestamps.



6. **Styling**: The component uses shadcn/ui components (`Button`, `Card`, etc.) for consistent styling.


This implementation provides an interactive way to demonstrate how the `customSetInterval` function works. Users can start the interval, see it logging messages at regular intervals, and then stop it at will. The logged messages provide a clear visualization of the interval's behavior.

The component also handles edge cases, such as preventing multiple intervals from being started simultaneously and ensuring the interval is properly cleaned up when stopped.

Is there anything specific about this implementation you'd like me to explain further or any modifications you'd like to see?
