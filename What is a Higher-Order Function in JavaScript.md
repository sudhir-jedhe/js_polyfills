**What is a Higher-Order Function in JavaScript?**
A higher-order function is a function that either:

Takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e., functions that are passed to it).
Returns a function as its result (i.e., it outputs a function).
In simpler terms, a higher-order function is a function that operates on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or returning them.

**Why Are Higher-Order Functions Useful?**
Higher-order functions allow you to:

Abstract away repetitive tasks: You can write more reusable and composable code by passing different functions to the same higher-order function.

Create powerful abstractions: Many functions in JavaScript, such as map(), filter(), and reduce(), are higher-order functions that make working with arrays and data structures easier and more flexible.

**Examples of Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript**
Function Taking Another Function as an Argument
In this example, we have a higher-order function operate, which accepts a function (callback) as an argument and executes it.

```javascript

function operate(a, b, callback) {
  return callback(a, b);
}

function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

console.log(operate(5, 3, add));       // 8
console.log(operate(5, 3, multiply));  // 15
```
Here, operate is a higher-order function because it accepts the add and multiply functions as arguments and invokes them within the body.

add and multiply are callback functions that operate calls with two numbers.
You can pass any other function that matches the signature of the callback (i.e., a function that takes two arguments and returns a result).
Function Returning Another Function
A higher-order function can also return a function. Here’s an example of a function multiplyBy that returns another function:

```javascript
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function(x) {
    return x * factor;
  };
}

const multiplyBy2 = multiplyBy(2);  // Returns a function that multiplies by 2
const multiplyBy3 = multiplyBy(3);  // Returns a function that multiplies by 3

console.log(multiplyBy2(5));  // 10
console.log(multiplyBy3(5));  // 15
```
In this case:

multiplyBy is a higher-order function because it returns a new function.
multiplyBy2 and multiplyBy3 are functions created by calling multiplyBy with different arguments.
This is useful when you need to create specialized functions on the fly, such as curried functions or factory functions.

Built-in JavaScript Higher-Order Functions
JavaScript provides several built-in higher-order functions, especially for working with arrays. Some of the most common ones are:

`map`() - Returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function(num) {
  return num * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers);  // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```
`map` is a higher-order function because it takes a function as an argument and applies that function to each element in the array.
`filter`() - Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers);  // [2, 4]

```

`filter` is a higher-order function because it accepts a callback function that determines whether an element should be included in the new array.
`reduce`() - Applies a function to accumulate or reduce all elements in the array into a single result.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = numbers.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue) {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum);  // 15
```
`reduce` is a higher-order function because it takes a function (the callback) to reduce an array into a single value.


**Advantages of Higher-Order Functions**
`Code Reusability:` You can write a function once and reuse it with different logic. For example, map, filter, and reduce allow you to process arrays in a variety of ways using different callback functions.

`Composability:` Functions that return other functions or take functions as arguments enable the composition of complex functionality by combining smaller, simpler functions.

`Functional Programming:` Higher-order functions are a key concept in functional programming, enabling immutability, function composition, and the ability to pass functions around as first-class citizens.

`Abstraction:` By passing behavior (in the form of functions) as arguments or returning new functions, you can abstract out complexity, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

**Example:** Currying with Higher-Order Functions
`Currying` is a common technique in functional programming where a function returns another function to handle partial application of arguments.

```javascript
function multiply(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a * b;
  };
}

const multiplyBy2 = multiply(2);
console.log(multiplyBy2(5));  // 10

const multiplyBy3 = multiply(3);
console.log(multiplyBy3(5));  // 15
```

The `multiply` function is a higher-order function that returns a function that multiplies its argument by a.
This is useful when you want to generate new functions dynamically based on different values of a.

**Conclusion**
A higher-order function is a function that:

Takes other functions as arguments.
Returns a function as its result.

Higher-order functions are foundational to functional programming and allow you to write more flexible, reusable, and concise code. 

They are used extensively in JavaScript, especially in array manipulation methods like map, filter, and reduce, and in advanced patterns like currying and function composition.
