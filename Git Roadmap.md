Git Roadmap for Developers: Learn the Workflow, Not Just the Commands

Many developers start with three Git commands:

git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push

And that's enough... until you start working on real projects.

Once you collaborate with a team, review pull requests, resolve merge conflicts, or recover from mistakes, you realize Git is much more than a version control tool.

It's a collaboration tool.

If I were learning Git today, this is the roadmap I'd follow.

🟢 Level 1 — Build Your Foundation

Master the commands you'll use every day.

✅ git init

✅ git clone

✅ git status

✅ git add

✅ git commit

✅ git push

✅ git pull

✅ git log

🎯 Goal: Understand how changes move from your local machine to a remote repository.

🌿 Level 2 — Learn Team Collaboration

This is where Git becomes powerful.

Practice:

✅ git branch

✅ git switch

✅ git checkout

✅ git fetch

✅ git merge

✅ Pull Requests

✅ Merge Conflict Resolution

🎯 Goal: Develop every feature in its own branch and collaborate without disrupting the main branch.

🛠️ Level 3 — Learn to Recover From Mistakes

Every developer makes mistakes.

Experienced developers know how to recover quickly.

Practice:

✅ git restore

✅ git reset

✅ git revert

✅ git stash

✅ git diff

🎯 Goal: Understand the difference between undoing local changes, reverting shared commits, and temporarily saving unfinished work.

⚡ Level 4 — Become a Git Power User

Once you're comfortable, explore advanced workflows.

Learn:

✅ git rebase

✅ Interactive Rebase

✅ Cherry-pick

✅ Git Tags

✅ Git Bisect

These commands are incredibly useful for maintaining a clean commit history and debugging production issues.

💡 The Best Way to Learn Git

Don't memorize commands.

Instead, create a sandbox repository and experiment.

✔ Create multiple branches.

✔ Introduce merge conflicts.

✔ Undo commits.

✔ Recover deleted work.

✔ Rebase feature branches.

✔ Practice resolving conflicts.

The more mistakes you make in a practice repository, the more confident you'll become in real projects.

🚀 Interview Tip

Git interviews are becoming increasingly scenario-based.

Be prepared to answer questions like:

What's the difference between merge and rebase?

When would you use revert instead of reset?

How do you resolve merge conflicts?

What happens when someone force-pushes to a shared branch?

These discussions often reveal how comfortable you are working in collaborative development environments.

📁 Create a Repository

✅ git init → Initialize a new Git repository

✅ git clone <repository> → Clone an existing repository

✍️ Track Changes

✅ git status → View modified, staged, and untracked files

✅ git add <file> → Stage a specific file

✅ git add . → Stage all changes

💾 Save Your Progress

✅ git commit -m "message" → Save a snapshot of your changes

✅ git log → View commit history

✅ git diff → Compare changes before committing

🌿 Work with Branches

✅ git branch → List available branches

✅ git switch -c feature-name → Create and switch to a new branch

✅ git switch feature-name → Move between branches

✅ git merge feature-name → Merge changes into the current branch

☁️ Collaborate with Your Team

✅ git pull → Fetch and merge the latest changes

✅ git fetch → Download updates without merging

✅ git push → Push local commits to the remote repository

↩️ Recover from Mistakes

✅ git restore <file> → Discard local file changes

✅ git reset --soft HEAD~1 → Undo the last commit while keeping changes

✅ git revert <commit> → Create a new commit that safely reverses a previous one

💡 Interview Tip

Instead of simply explaining Git commands, be prepared to answer scenario-based questions like:

✔ What would you do if two developers modified the same file?

✔ What's the difference between merge and rebase?

✔ When would you use revert instead of reset?

✔ How do you resolve merge conflicts?
