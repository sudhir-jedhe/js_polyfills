Your provided code snippets correctly demonstrate different types of common JavaScript errors. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each error type along with the explanation:

### 1. **Syntax Error:**
   A syntax error occurs when the structure of the code is incorrect, breaking the rules of the JavaScript language.

   ```javascript
   /*
   const func = () =>
   console.log(hello)
   }
   */
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - The error happens because the function definition is incomplete, and thereâ€™s an extra closing curly brace (`}`) without a matching opening one. JavaScript expects a valid syntax structure to be followed.
   - The corrected version should look like this:
     ```javascript
     const func = () => {
       console.log(hello); // 'hello' should be a string or variable, and also needs to be declared
     };
     ```

### 2. **Reference Error:**
   A reference error occurs when a variable is referenced before it is defined, or it does not exist in the scope.

   ```javascript
   // console.log(x);
   //             ^
   // ReferenceError: x is not defined
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - In this case, `x` is referenced but never declared or assigned a value. Hence, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.
   - To fix this, you should define the variable before using it:
     ```javascript
     let x = 10;
     console.log(x); // 10
     ```

### 3. **Type Error:**
   A type error happens when an operation is performed on a value of an incorrect data type.

   ```javascript
   let num = 15;
   console.log(num.split("")); //converts a number to an array
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `num` is a number, and the `split()` method is designed for strings, not numbers. Since numbers do not have a `split()` method, it throws a `TypeError`.
   - To fix this, you would need to convert the number to a string first:
     ```javascript
     let num = 15;
     console.log(num.toString().split("")); // ["1", "5"]
     ```

### 4. **Range Error:**
   A range error occurs when a value is not within an acceptable range, typically used with functions expecting values within a specific boundary.

   ```javascript
   const checkRange = (num) => {
     if (num < 30) throw new RangeError("Wrong number");
     return true;
   };

   checkRange(20);
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - In this case, the `checkRange` function throws a `RangeError` when the number is less than 30.
   - The error is explicitly thrown using `throw new RangeError("Wrong number")`, which is caught as a range error.
