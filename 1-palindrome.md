You’ve presented several ways to check for palindromes, both for numbers and strings. Let’s break them down for clarity:

### 1. Palindrome Check for Numbers
Your `isPalindrome` function for numbers works as follows:

```javascript
var isPalindrome = function (x) {
  return x < 0 ? false : x === +x.toString().split("").reverse().join("");
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Negative numbers:** Negative numbers cannot be palindromes because the negative sign will never match at both ends.
- **Positive numbers:** Converts the number to a string, reverses the string, and checks if the reversed string is the same as the original.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(isPalindrome(121));  // Output: true
console.log(isPalindrome(10));   // Output: false
```

### 2. Palindrome Check for Strings (Non-Alphanumeric Characters & Case-Insensitive)

Your `isPalindrome` function for strings cleans up non-alphanumeric characters and converts the string to lowercase before checking for palindrome:

```javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
  const cleanStr = str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
  return cleanStr === cleanStr.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Remove non-alphanumeric characters:** The regular expression `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` removes anything that's not a letter or digit.
- **Convert to lowercase:** `.toLowerCase()` makes the check case-insensitive.
- **Reverse and compare:** It compares the cleaned string with its reversed version.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(isPalindrome("manuunam"));       // Output: true
console.log(isPalindrome("race car"));       // Output: true
console.log(isPalindrome("algochurn practice")); // Output: false
```

### 3. Palindrome Check with Two-Pointer Approach

Your `palindromeCheckTwoPointers` function is an efficient approach where two pointers are used to compare characters from the left and right ends:

```javascript
const palindromeCheckTwoPointers = (str) => {
  let left = 0;
  let right = str.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    if (str[left] !== str[right]) {
      return false;
    }
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Two pointers:** One pointer starts at the beginning (`left`), and the other starts at the end (`right`).
- **Comparison:** As long as characters from the left and right match, the pointers move towards the center.
- **Efficiency:** Time complexity is **O(n)** since each character is checked only once.

#### Example:

```javascript
const str = "manuunam";
console.log(palindromeCheckTwoPointers(str)); // Output: true
```

### 4. Palindrome Check with Recursion

The recursive version `palindromeCheckRecursive` checks characters recursively by incrementing the index from the left and decrementing from the right:

```javascript
const palindromeCheckRecursive = (str, i = 0) => {
  let j = str.length - 1 - i;
  if (i >= j) {
    return true;
  }
  if (str[i] !== str[j]) {
    return false;
  }
  return palindromeCheckRecursive(str, i + 1);
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Base case:** When `i >= j`, it means the middle of the string is reached, and the string is a palindrome.
- **Comparison:** It compares characters from the two ends, recursively checking the inner characters.
- **Efficiency:** This is also **O(n)** in time complexity, but has higher space complexity due to the recursive stack.

#### Example:

```javascript
const str = "manuunam";
console.log(palindromeCheckRecursive(str)); // Output: true
```

---

### Performance Comparison:
- **`isPalindrome` (Number) function**: This uses string manipulation, which is **O(n)** in time complexity where `n` is the number of digits.
- **`isPalindrome` (String) function**: Similar, with time complexity **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string after cleaning.
- **Two-Pointer Method**: Also **O(n)**, but it’s generally more space-efficient than string manipulation methods because no additional string is created.
- **Recursive Method**: Time complexity is **O(n)**, but space complexity can be a bit higher due to recursion stack space.

### Optimizations:
- The **two-pointer approach** is the most space-efficient and works well for long strings.
- If you were to handle large numbers, you could avoid converting them to strings by using mathematical methods (e.g., reversing the number numerically).
