• What exactly is normal page flow?
• What does position relative to itself really mean?
• Who is the nearest positioned ancestor in absolute positioning?
• What does it mean when we say an element is positioned relative to the viewport?
• Why does sticky behave like relative and fixed at the same time?

I used to get seriously frustrated with this one basic CSS topic positioning. Every time I revised before an interview, I had to pause and think:
“Wait… what was the difference again?” It felt like I was relearning the same thing from scratch… again and again. So I stopped memorizing definitions and started visualizing it using a simple car on a road story and suddenly, everything clicked.

Here’s the version that finally made it stick in my head:

Static — The normal traffic car
The car just follows the road rules and stays in line.
👉 The element stays in the normal page flow, meaning it appears in the natural order of the document (one below another) and cannot be moved using top, left, right, or bottom.

Relative — The car that shifts in its own lane
The car moves slightly but its original parking space is still reserved.
👉 The element is positioned relative to itself, meaning it first stays in its normal spot, then shifts from that same position, while its original space remains occupied.

Absolute — The VIP car that parks in a building
This car leaves the road and parks inside the nearest building instead of staying in traffic.
👉 The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (the closest parent with position set to relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky) and is removed from normal page flow.

Fixed — The car stuck on your screen
No matter how much the city scrolls, this car stays in the same place on your mobile screen.
👉 The element is positioned relative to the viewport (the visible browser screen area) and does not move when the page scrolls.

Sticky — The police car that stops at the top
The car moves normally with traffic, but once it reaches the top of the road, it stops and stays there while others pass.
👉 The element behaves like normal flow at first, then sticks relative to the scroll position when it reaches a defined point (like top: 0).

This one mental model helped me remember all five position values without memorizing textbook lines and honestly, this is one of the most common CSS questions in frontend interviews.

Sometimes, the best way to understand code… is to turn it into a story.
