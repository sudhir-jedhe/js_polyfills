CSS **pseudo-classes** are used to define the special state or condition of an element. They allow you to style elements based on user interactions, document structure, or other criteria. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of **all CSS pseudo-classes**, categorized by their functionality:

### 1. **User Action Pseudo-Classes**
These pseudo-classes are applied based on user interactions or actions.

- **`:hover`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied when the user hovers over an element (e.g., a link or button).
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    a:hover {
      color: red;
    }
    ```

- **`:active`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied when an element is being activated by the user, such as when a link or button is clicked.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    button:active {
      background-color: yellow;
    }
    ```

- **`:focus`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied when an element has focus, typically when a user clicks or tabs to an input field or link.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    input:focus {
      border-color: blue;
    }
    ```

- **`:focus-visible`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied when an element receives focus and should be visually indicated as focused (mainly for accessibility purposes).
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    button:focus-visible {
      outline: 2px solid blue;
    }
    ```

- **`:focus-within`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied to an element when it or any of its descendants receive focus.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    .form-group:focus-within {
      border-color: green;
    }
    ```

### 2. **Structural Pseudo-Classes**
These pseudo-classes target an element based on its position in the document or its relationship to other elements.

- **`:first-child`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied to the first child element of a parent.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    p:first-child {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```

- **`:last-child`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied to the last child element of a parent.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    p:last-child {
      margin-bottom: 0;
    }
    ```

- **`:nth-child(n)`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied to elements based on their position in a parent element. You can use a number, keyword, or formula to select specific children.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    li:nth-child(2) {
      color: red;
    }
    li:nth-child(odd) {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }
    li:nth-child(3n) {
      color: blue;
    }
    ```

- **`:nth-last-child(n)`**
  - **Purpose**: Similar to `:nth-child()`, but counts elements from the end (last child).
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    li:nth-last-child(1) {
      color: green;
    }
    ```

- **`:only-child`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied to an element if it is the only child of its parent.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    p:only-child {
      font-size: 20px;
    }
    ```

- **`:only-of-type`**
  - **Purpose**: Applied to an element if it is the only element of its type (tag name) in its parent.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    p:only-of-type {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```

    ```css
    :root {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    ```

### 3. **State-based Pseudo-Classes**
These pseudo-classes apply based on the state or condition of the element.
