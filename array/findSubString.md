Both implementations you provided aim to solve the problem of finding all starting indices in a string `s` where a concatenation of words from the list `words` appears. Let's walk through the two approaches and analyze their correctness and efficiency.

### Approach 1: Sliding Window with Word Count Map

In the first approach, we are essentially implementing a **sliding window** technique combined with a **hash map** to track the occurrences of words.

1. **Word Count Map**: First, we create a map to store how many times each word appears in the `words` array.
2. **Sliding Window**: Then, we slide a window across the string `s`. The window's size is equal to the total length of all the words in `words`, and it only looks at substrings that are of the same length as a word in `words` (assuming all words have the same length).
3. **Checking Valid Substrings**: As we slide the window, for each new word found within the window, we increment its count in a `currentMap`. If any word appears more than its count in `wordCountMap`, we break the loop early. If all words in the window match the required frequency, we add the starting index of the window to the result.
4. **Efficiency**: The sliding window approach ensures that we only look at each substring of the appropriate length and can immediately stop checking as soon as we know the window is invalid.

#### Code:

```javascript
function findSubstring(s, words) {
    if (words.length === 0 || s.length === 0) {
        return [];
    }
    
    const wordCountMap = {};
    for (let word of words) {
        if (word in wordCountMap) {
            wordCountMap[word]++;
        } else {
            wordCountMap[word] = 1;
        }
    }
    
    const wordLength = words[0].length;
    const totalLength = wordLength * words.length;
    const result = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - totalLength; i++) {
        const currentMap = {};
        let j = 0;
        
        while (j < words.length) {
            const currentWord = s.substr(i + j * wordLength, wordLength);
            
            if (!(currentWord in wordCountMap)) {
                break;
            }
            
            if (currentWord in currentMap) {
                currentMap[currentWord]++;
            } else {
                currentMap[currentWord] = 1;
            }
            
            if (currentMap[currentWord] > wordCountMap[currentWord]) {
                break;
            }
            
            j++;
        }
        
        if (j === words.length) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Example Test Cases:

```javascript
console.log(findSubstring("barfoothefoobarman", ["foo", "bar"])); // Output: [0, 9]
console.log(findSubstring("wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", ["word", "good", "best", "word"]));  // Output: []
console.log(findSubstring("barfoofoobarthefoobarman", ["bar", "foo", "the"]));  // Output: [6, 9, 12]
```

### Explanation:

1. **`"barfoothefoobarman", ["foo", "bar"]`**: Both "foo" and "bar" appear as substrings starting at indices 0 and 9.
2. **`"wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", ["word", "good", "best", "word"]`**: There is no valid substring that contains all words "word", "good", "best" exactly once, so the output is an empty array.
3. **`"barfoofoobarthefoobarman", ["bar", "foo", "the"]`**: The valid substrings are at indices 6, 9, and 12.

### Time Complexity:
- **Word Count Map Construction**: O(m * k), where `m` is the number of words in `words` and `k` is the length of each word.
- **Sliding Window Loop**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, as we are iterating through the string and checking substrings of length `wordLength` (constant time operations).
- Overall: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

### Approach 2: Sliding Window with `have` Map

The second approach is another variation of the sliding window technique, but with a slightly different method for managing the counts of words in the window.

1. **Word Count (`needed`)**: We create a `needed` map to count the required occurrences of each word from `words`.
2. **Sliding Window (`have`)**: We maintain a `have` map to keep track of the current window's word counts. The window slides over `s`, checking if the words match the expected counts in `needed`.
3. **Efficiency**: This approach is very similar to the first approach, but it uses a slightly different method to check if the window is valid by checking if every word in the current window's `have` map satisfies the condition of appearing less than or equal to the required count in `needed`.

#### Code:

```javascript
function findSubstring(s, words) {
    const wordLen = words[0].length; // Assume all words have the same length
    const needed = words.reduce((acc, word) => {
      acc[word] = (acc[word] || 0) + 1;
      return acc;
    }, {}); // Count needed occurrences of each word
    const have = {}; // Track current word occurrences in the window
  
    let left = 0, right = 0, result = [];
    const windowLen = wordLen * words.length; // Total length of the concatenated string
  
    while (right <= s.length) {
      const word = s.substring(right, right + wordLen);
  
      // Handle window outside string or word not in the list
      if (right + wordLen > s.length || !word) {
        left++;
        have = {}; // Reset word counts in the window
        right = left;
        continue;
      }
  
      // Update have count for the current word
      have[word] = (have[word] || 0) + 1;
  
      // Check if all words in the window have enough occurrences
      const allPresent = Object.entries(have).every(([word, count]) => count <= needed[word]);
  
      // If window is full and all words are present, add starting index
      if (right - left + 1 === windowLen && allPresent) {
        result.push(left);
      }
  
      // Slide the window
      right += wordLen;
    }
  
    return result;
}
```

### Example Test Cases:

```javascript
console.log(findSubstring("barfoothefoobarman", ["foo", "bar"])); // Output: [0, 9]
console.log(findSubstring("wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", ["word", "good", "best", "word"]));  // Output: []
console.log(findSubstring("barfoofoobarthefoobarman", ["bar", "foo", "the"]));  // Output: [6, 9, 12]
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Word Count Construction (`needed`)**: O(m * k), where `m` is the number of words and `k` is the length of each word.
- **Sliding Window**: O(n), where `n` is the length of `s`.
- Overall: **O(n)**.

### Final Thoughts:
Both approaches are correct and have similar time complexity, but the first approach is simpler and easier to follow with fewer edge cases to handle. It avoids some extra complexity with the use of a `have` map and simplifies the logic for checking if the current window contains the required words. I recommend using the first approach unless you have specific reasons to choose the second one.
