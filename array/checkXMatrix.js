A square matrix is said to be an X-Matrix if both of the following conditions hold:

All the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are non-zero.
All other elements are 0.
Given a 2D integer array grid of size n x n representing a square matrix, return true if grid is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return false.


Input: grid = [[5,7,0],[0,3,1],[0,5,0]]
Output: false
Explanation: Refer to the diagram above.
An X-Matrix should have the green elements (diagonals) be non-zero and the red elements be 0.
Thus, grid is not an X-Matrix.


Input: grid = [[2,0,0,1],[0,3,1,0],[0,5,2,0],[4,0,0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: Refer to the diagram above. 
An X-Matrix should have the green elements (diagonals) be non-zero and the red elements be 0.
Thus, grid is an X-Matrix.


function checkXMatrix(grid: number[][]): boolean {
    const n = grid.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i == j || i + j == n - 1) {
                if (!grid[i][j]) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else if (grid[i][j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
