Sampling, shuffling and weighted selection in JavaScript arrays

Random value selection and shuffling are essential tools to have when working with arrays in JavaScript. While Math.random() seems like the easy solution for everything, it's sometimes not enough. In other cases, it's not obvious how to use it to get, for example, a random element while taking into account weight factors. Luckily, there's a solution for every one of these problems.

Shuffle an array
Using Math.random() to shuffle an array seems like the obvious solution, yet it's heavily biased and not recommended. Instead, you can use the Fisher-Yates algorithm to reorder the elements of the array. This algorithm is efficient and unbiased, and it's the go-to solution for shuffling arrays. The implementation below creates a new array and shuffles the elements of the original array into it.

const shuffle = ([...arr]) => {
  let m = arr.length;
  while (m) {
    const i = Math.floor(Math.random() * m--);
    [arr[m], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[m]];
  }
  return arr;
};

const foo = [1, 2, 3];
shuffle(foo); // [2, 3, 1], foo = [1, 2, 3]
Sample a random element from an array
Getting a random element from an array is as simple as generating a random index and returning the element at that index. To calculate the index, you can use Math.random() and Array.prototype.length to generate a random number in the range of the array's length. Additionally, you need to use Math.floor() to round the number down to the nearest integer.

const sample = arr => arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];

sample([3, 7, 9, 11]); // 9
Sample multiple random elements from an array
Sampling multiple elements is a little more involved. Using the shuffle function provided above, you can use Array.prototype.slice() to get the first n elements from the shuffled array. If you don't provide a second argument, n, you'll get only one element at random from the array.

const shuffle = ([...arr]) => {
  let m = arr.length;
  while (m) {
    const i = Math.floor(Math.random() * m--);
    [arr[m], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[m]];
  }
  return arr;
};

const sampleSize = ([...arr], n = 1) => shuffle(arr).slice(0, n);

sampleSize([1, 2, 3], 2); // [3, 1]
sampleSize([1, 2, 3], 4); // [2, 3, 1]
Weighted sample from an array
A more advanced use cases might involve weighted selection, where the probability of each element being selected is provided upfront. In order for this to work, you can use Array.prototype.reduce() to create an array of partial sums for each value in weights. Then, you can use Math.random() to generate a random number and Array.prototype.findIndex() to find the correct index based on it.

const weightedSample = (arr, weights) => {
  let roll = Math.random();
  return arr[
    weights
      .reduce(
        (acc, w, i) => (i === 0 ? [w] : [...acc, acc[acc.length - 1] + w]),
        []
      )
      .findIndex((v, i, s) => roll >= (i === 0 ? 0 : s[i - 1]) && roll < v)
  ];
};

weightedSample([3, 7, 9, 11], [0.1, 0.2, 0.6, 0.1]); // 9
