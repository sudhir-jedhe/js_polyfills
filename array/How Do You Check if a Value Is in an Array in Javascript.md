You've demonstrated three common methods for checking if a value exists in an array in JavaScript. Here's a quick breakdown of the methods you've used:

### 1. **Using `.includes()`**

The `.includes()` method checks if a certain value exists in an array. It returns `true` if the element is found, otherwise it returns `false`. It's very straightforward to use and works well for primitive values (numbers, strings, booleans).

```javascript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(myArray.includes(1)); // true
console.log(myArray.includes(7)); // false
```

- **Explanation**: `.includes()` checks whether the array contains `1` and `7`. 
  - For `1`, it returns `true` since it's present in the array.
  - For `7`, it returns `false` since it's not found in the array.

### 2. **Using `.indexOf()`**

The `.indexOf()` method returns the first index of the value in the array. If the value is not found, it returns `-1`. To check if an element exists, you can compare the result with `-1`.

```javascript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(myArray.indexOf(1) !== -1); // true
console.log(myArray.indexOf(7) !== -1); // false
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - `.indexOf(1)` returns `0`, because `1` is at index `0` in the array, so the condition `!== -1` results in `true`.
  - `.indexOf(7)` returns `-1`, because `7` is not in the array, so the condition results in `false`.

### 3. **Using `.find()`**

The `.find()` method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the condition, it returns `undefined`.

```javascript
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(myArray.find(value => value === 1)); // 1
console.log(myArray.find(value => value === 7)); // undefined
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `.find(value => value === 1)` returns `1` because it finds `1` in the array.
  - `.find(value => value === 7)` returns `undefined` because `7` is not found in the array.

### Summary of Differences:

- `.includes()`: Returns `true` or `false`. It’s concise and ideal for checking the presence of an element, especially for primitive types.
- `.indexOf()`: Returns the index of the element or `-1` if not found. You have to check if the result is not `-1` to determine presence.
- `.find()`: Returns the element itself if it’s found, otherwise `undefined`. It’s more flexible as it allows checking based on a condition, but may be overkill for simple presence checks.

Each method has its ideal use case depending on the context and what you want to achieve. For basic checks, `.includes()` is usually the simplest and most expressive.
