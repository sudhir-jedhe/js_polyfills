Let's break down both versions of your function for finding the repeated and missing numbers in a grid, and ensure that the logic is correct and clear.

### Function 1: `findMissingAndRepeatedValues`
This function works by:

1. **Calculating the expected sum** of all numbers from `1` to `n` (assuming this grid should contain numbers in the range from `1` to `n`).
2. **Iterating through the grid** to calculate the actual sum, and at the same time, identifying the repeated number (the one that appears more than once).
3. **Finding the missing number** by subtracting the actual sum (minus the repeated number) from the expected sum.

#### Code Review:

```javascript
function findMissingAndRepeatedValues(grid) {
    const n = grid.length; // Get the grid size (number of rows)
    const expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2; // Expected sum from 1 to n (assuming numbers from 1 to n)
    let actualSum = 0;
    const seen = new Set();
    let repeated = -1;

    // Traverse the grid to calculate the actual sum and find the repeated number
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            const num = grid[i][j];
            actualSum += num;
            if (seen.has(num)) {
                repeated = num; // Found repeated number
            } else {
                seen.add(num); // Add new number to the set
            }
        }
    }

    // The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and (actualSum - repeated)
    const missing = expectedSum - (actualSum - repeated);

    return [repeated, missing];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findMissingAndRepeatedValues([[1,3],[2,2]])); // Output: [2, 4]
console.log(findMissingAndRepeatedValues([[9,1,7],[8,9,2],[3,4,6]])); // Output: [9, 5]
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Time complexity**: This approach loops through the grid, visiting each element once, so the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows/columns in the grid (assuming it's square).
2. **Space complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to storing numbers in the `Set` to track duplicates.
3. **Correctness**: This logic is solid for the problem of identifying the repeated and missing values in a grid, assuming each number should be in the range `[1, n]` and only one number is missing and repeated.

### Function 2: `findMissingAndRepeated`
This function takes a different approach:

1. It calculates **row sums** and **column sums** instead of directly calculating the sum of numbers.
2. It calculates the **missing number** based on row sums and the **repeated number** based on column sums.
3. The `sum` function takes the sum of a set of values, which seems to be an unconventional way to calculate the repeated number.

#### Code Review:

```javascript
function findMissingAndRepeated(grid) {
    const n = grid.length; // Get the grid size
    const expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2; // Expected sum from 1 to n (assuming numbers from 1 to n)

    const rowSums = grid.map(row => row.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0)); // Row sums
    const colSums = grid.reduce((colSums, row) => {
        row.forEach((val, colIndex) => {
            colSums[colIndex] = (colSums[colIndex] || 0) + val;
        });
        return colSums;
    }, new Array(n).fill(0)); // Column sums

    // Missing number is the difference between the expected sum and row sum
    const missing = expectedSum - rowSums.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);

    // The repeated number is calculated by finding the sum of the unique row sums
    const repeated = (expectedSum - colSums.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0)) + sum(new Set(rowSums));

    return [repeated, missing];
}

function sum(set) {
    let total = 0;
    for (const value of set) {
        total += value;
    }
    return total;
}

// Example usage:
const grid1 = [[1, 3], [2, 2]];
const grid2 = [[9, 1, 7], [8, 9, 2], [3, 4, 6]];

console.log(findMissingAndRepeated(grid1)); // Output: [2, 4]
console.log(findMissingAndRepeated(grid2)); // Output: [9, 5]
```

#### Issues:
1. **The logic for finding the repeated number is a bit complex** and doesn't directly relate to how the numbers should behave in the grid.
2. **Sum of row sums** and **sum of column sums** does not necessarily help in identifying the repeated or missing number. The primary method in `findMissingAndRepeatedValues` is simpler and more straightforward for this problem.
3. The function `sum` adds up the unique values in `rowSums`, which might be incorrect if the grid's structure doesn't perfectly fit the expected behavior.

### Suggestion:
I would recommend using the first approach (`findMissingAndRepeatedValues`) for clarity and correctness. The second approach seems to involve unnecessary complexity and may not give the correct result for grids with irregular or unexpected numbers.

### Summary:
- **Best Approach**: The first function (`findMissingAndRepeatedValues`) is more efficient and clear for finding the repeated and missing values in a grid.
- **Complexity**: The second approach involves additional steps (row/column sums) that are not necessary to solve the problem effectively.
