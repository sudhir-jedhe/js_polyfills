The function you've provided implements the solution to a **Sudoku puzzle** using **backtracking**, a technique where the algorithm tries to solve the puzzle step by step and backtracks whenever it encounters an invalid state.

### Let's break down how this works:

1. **isValid(board, row, col, num)**: This function checks if placing a number (`num`) at the position (`row`, `col`) on the board is valid. It ensures that:
   - The number isn't already present in the same row.
   - The number isn't already present in the same column.
   - The number isn't already present in the same 3x3 sub-grid.

2. **solve(board)**: This function attempts to solve the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
   - It iterates through each cell of the board.
   - If a cell contains a dot (`"."`), it tries placing each number from `1` to `9` in that position.
   - For each number, it calls `isValid()` to check if placing that number is valid.
   - If valid, it places the number and recursively calls `solve(board)` to proceed with the next empty cell.
   - If the board becomes invalid at any point (i.e., no number can be placed in a given cell), the algorithm backtracks by resetting the cell to `"."` and trying the next number.
   - If it successfully fills in all empty cells, the puzzle is solved.

3. **solveSudoku(board)**: This is the main function that invokes the recursive backtracking solution. It simply calls the `solve(board)` function to solve the puzzle and returns the completed board.

### Example:

You provided a Sudoku board, and when you call `solveSudoku(board)`, it will return the completed puzzle. Let's walk through the given board:

```javascript
const board = [
    ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
    ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
    [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
    ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
    ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
    ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
    [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
    [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
    [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
];
```

After running `solveSudoku(board)`, the board will be modified in place to:

```javascript
[
    ["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],
    ["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],
    ["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],
    ["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],
    ["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],
    ["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],
    ["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],
    ["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],
    ["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]
]
```

### Key Concepts:
- **Backtracking**: A form of recursion where the algorithm tries possible solutions one by one and backtracks when it hits a dead-end (i.e., no solution can be found). This is exactly how Sudoku solvers work — trying to fill in the grid and backtracking if necessary.
- **Efficiency**: While backtracking is not the most efficient method for very large problems, it's quite effective for Sudoku because the solution space is constrained (9x9 grid with limited numbers).

### Time Complexity:
- In the worst case, backtracking tries all possible placements for every empty cell. For a 9x9 grid, the complexity could seem exponential, but in practice, the constraints of Sudoku (numbers 1–9, row/column/block rules) drastically reduce the number of possibilities.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** in terms of auxiliary space because we are modifying the input array in place and the recursion depth is bounded by the number of empty cells.

This is a well-known approach for solving Sudoku puzzles efficiently with recursion and backtracking!
