Remove matching elements from a JavaScript array

Array.prototype.filter() is the de facto way of filtering array elements based on a condition. But, what if you wanted to remove array elements that match a condition, instead of keeping them? Here are two ways you can do it.

Inverting the condition
The simplest way to remove elements from an array that match a condition is to invert the condition. For example, if you want to remove all even numbers from an array, you can filter out all odd numbers instead.

In order to do so, you can simply negate the predicate function and use Array.prototype.filter() as usual.

const negate = fn => (...args) => !fn(...args);
const remove = (arr, fn) => arr.filter(negate(fn));

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const isEven = n => n % 2 === 0;
remove(nums, isEven); // [1, 3]
nums; // [1, 2, 3, 4]
Mutating the array
While mutating the array is often undesirable, it's worth mentioning that there's a way to mutate the array directly by using Array.prototype.reduce(). All you have to do is find the matching elements using Array.prototype.filter() and then remove them using Array.prototype.splice().

An interesting side effect of this approach is that it returns the removed elements, which can be useful in some cases. You might think of this as a conditional Array.prototype.splice().

const spliceFilter = (arr, fn) =>
  arr.filter(fn).reduce((acc, val) => {
    arr.splice(arr.indexOf(val), 1);
    return acc.concat(val);
  }, []);

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const isEven = n => n % 2 === 0;
spliceFilter(nums, isEven); // [2, 4]
nums; // [1, 3]

Apart from mutating the original array, this approach is significantly less performant and should be avoided in most cases. It's included here mainly for educational purposes.
