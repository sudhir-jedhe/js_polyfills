You've implemented a custom version of the `.includes()` method for arrays, named `customIncludes`, which behaves similarly to the native `.includes()` method. Here's a breakdown of the implementation and its usage, followed by an explanation of the example cases:

### 1. **Custom `.includes()` Implementation:**

```javascript
Array.prototype.customIncludes = function (searchElement, fromIndex = 0) {
  const length = this.length;

  // Handle negative indices
  let startIndex = fromIndex >= 0 ? fromIndex : Math.max(0, length + fromIndex);

  for (let i = startIndex; i < length; i++) {
    if (
      this[i] === searchElement ||
      (Number.isNaN(this[i]) && Number.isNaN(searchElement))
    ) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
};
```

### Explanation of the Custom `.includes()` Method:
- **`searchElement`**: The element we are searching for in the array.
- **`fromIndex`**: The index at which to start the search (default is `0`).
- **Handling Negative Indices**: If `fromIndex` is negative, we calculate the correct starting index by adding it to the length of the array. This is similar to how negative indices work in other languages.
- **Looping through the Array**: We iterate through the array starting from `startIndex`, and check if the element at index `i` is equal to `searchElement`. 
  - We use `===` to compare elements normally.
  - Special handling is done for `NaN` values because `NaN` is not equal to itself in JavaScript, so we explicitly check if both elements are `NaN` using `Number.isNaN()`.

If the element is found, the method returns `true`. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `false`.

### Example Usage:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(numbers.customIncludes(3)); // Output: true
console.log(numbers.customIncludes(6)); // Output: false
```

- **`numbers.customIncludes(3)`**: The element `3` is present in the array, so it returns `true`.
- **`numbers.customIncludes(6)`**: The element `6` is not present, so it returns `false`.

### 2. **Using Native `.includes()` with Strings:**

```javascript
const arr = ["Geeks", "for", "geeks", "Javascript", "HTML", "CSS"];

console.log(arr.includes("geeks")); // Output: true
console.log(arr.includes("Javascript")); // Output: true
console.log(arr.includes("CSS")); // Output: true
console.log(arr.includes("React")); // Output: false
```

- **`arr.includes("geeks")`**: Returns `true` because `"geeks"` exists as a string in the array (note that `.includes()` is case-sensitive).
- **`arr.includes("Javascript")`**: Returns `true` because `"Javascript"` is present.
- **`arr.includes("CSS")`**: Returns `true` because `"CSS"` is present.
- **`arr.includes("React")`**: Returns `false` because `"React"` is not present in the array.

### Key Points:
- **Case Sensitivity**: The `.includes()` method (both native and custom) is case-sensitive, meaning `"geeks"` and `"Geeks"` are considered different values.
- **NaN Handling**: Your custom implementation correctly handles `NaN` values, while the native `.includes()` method does not consider `NaN` equal to itself (e.g., `NaN === NaN` is `false`).
- **Negative Indices**: Your custom method supports negative `fromIndex` values, which is a nice feature that behaves similarly to Python or other languages' array slicing.

Your custom `.includes()` is a great exercise in understanding the underlying behavior of the native `.includes()` and how to extend its functionality, especially with custom logic for edge cases like `NaN` and negative indices!
