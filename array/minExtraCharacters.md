Both of the solutions you've provided aim to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "extra characters" in a string, given a dictionary of words. The goal is to use as many words from the dictionary as possible to cover the string, and the remaining characters that aren't part of any word in the dictionary are counted as "extra characters."

However, there are differences in the approach taken by both solutions. Let's analyze each of them and their behavior.

### **First Solution: Dynamic Programming with Substrings**

```javascript
function minExtraCharacters(s, dictionary) {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(Infinity);
    
    // Function to check if substring s[j...i] exists in the dictionary
    function isInDictionary(j, i) {
        const substring = s.substring(j, i + 1);
        return dictionary.includes(substring);
    }
    
    // Initialize dp[0]
    if (isInDictionary(0, 0)) {
        dp[0] = 0;
    } else {
        dp[0] = 1;
    }
    
    // Fill dp array
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (isInDictionary(0, i)) {
            dp[i] = 0;
        } else {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; // Worst case, consider s[i] as extra
        }
        
        // Check all possible substrings ending at i
        for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            if (isInDictionary(j, i)) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], j > 0 ? dp[j - 1] + (i - j + 1) : i + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n - 1];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minExtraCharacters("leetscode", ["leet", "code", "leetcode"])); // Output: 1
console.log(minExtraCharacters("sayhelloworld", ["hello", "world"])); // Output: 3
```

### **Explanation of the First Solution**:

1. **`dp` Array**: 
   - `dp[i]` stores the minimum number of extra characters needed for the substring `s[0...i]`.
   - It starts by setting all values in `dp` to `Infinity`, except `dp[0]` which is initialized based on whether the first character is part of the dictionary.

2. **`isInDictionary` Function**:
   - This function checks whether a substring of `s` exists in the dictionary.
   - `substring = s.substring(j, i + 1)` extracts the substring from index `j` to `i`.

3. **Filling `dp` Array**:
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`, the code checks:
     - If the substring `s[0...i]` exists in the dictionary, then `dp[i] = 0` (no extra characters).
     - Otherwise, it checks all substrings ending at `i` (from `j` to `i`) and if they exist in the dictionary, updates `dp[i]` accordingly.
     - The value `dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], j > 0 ? dp[j - 1] + (i - j + 1) : i + 1)` calculates the minimum extra characters needed by considering whether the substring from `j` to `i` can be part of a valid word or not.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The final answer is stored in `dp[n - 1]`, which gives the minimum extra characters required for the entire string.

### **Analysis of the First Solution**:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n^2 * m)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `m` is the average length of the dictionary words. This is because for each `i`, it checks all substrings from `j` to `i` and looks them up in the dictionary.
- The solution has a higher time complexity due to multiple nested loops and substring checks.

### **Second Solution: Recursive Approach with Memoization**

```javascript
function minExtraChars(s, dictionary) {
    const dp = new Array(s.length + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;
    const visited = {};
  
    const minExtraCharsHelper = (i) => {
      if (i in visited) return visited[i];
  
      let minExtra = Infinity;
      for (const word of dictionary) {
        const wordLength = word.length;
        if (i >= wordLength && s.slice(i - wordLength, i) === word) {
          const prevExtra = minExtraCharsHelper(i - wordLength);
          const extraInBetween = s.length - (i - wordLength) - wordLength;
          minExtra = Math.min(minExtra, prevExtra + extraInBetween);
        }
      }
  
      visited[i] = minExtra;
      return minExtra;
    };
  
    return minExtraCharsHelper(s.length);
}
  
// Example usage
const s = "leetscode";
const dictionary = ["leet", "code", "leetcode"];
const result = minExtraChars(s, dictionary);
console.log(result); // Output: 1
```

### **Explanation of the Second Solution**:

1. **`dp` Array**:
   - `dp[i]` stores the minimum extra characters for the substring `s[0...i]`. It is initialized to `Infinity` except for `dp[0]` which is `0`.

2. **`minExtraCharsHelper` Function**:
   - This is a recursive function that computes the minimum extra characters needed for the substring `s[0...i]`. The function uses **memoization** (`visited` object) to store already computed values for each index `i`, preventing redundant calculations.
   - The function loops through each word in the dictionary and checks if the current substring ending at `i` matches any word in the dictionary. If it matches, it recursively calculates the extra characters for the part of the string before this word.
   - The recursion ensures that all possible ways to split the string are explored.

3. **Memoization**:
   - The `visited` object is used to store results for each index `i` to avoid redundant recalculations and optimize performance.
   - The result for each `i` is computed once and stored, making the recursive calls faster.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The final result is computed by calling `minExtraCharsHelper(s.length)`, which gives the minimum number of extra characters needed for the entire string.

### **Analysis of the Second Solution**:
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the average length of the dictionary words. The recursion ensures that each substring is only computed once, and each dictionary word is checked once for each substring of `s`.
- This approach is more efficient in terms of time complexity because it avoids redundant substring computations by using memoization.

### **Conclusion**:
- **First Solution**: The first solution is based on dynamic programming, but it involves more complex logic and higher time complexity due to multiple nested loops and substring checks.
- **Second Solution**: The second solution, using recursion and memoization, is more efficient and easier to understand. It minimizes redundant calculations and provides a better performance for larger inputs.

**Recommendation**: The **second solution** is preferable due to its efficiency, simpler logic, and use of memoization for optimization.
