In the code you provided:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6, 7];
arr.length = 0;
console.log(arr); // [] => length = 0
```

### Explanation:
- Initially, `arr` is an array with the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, -6, 7]`.
- Setting `arr.length = 0` **removes all elements** from the array. 
  - This is because in JavaScript, an arrayâ€™s `length` property directly affects the number of elements in the array.
  - When you set the `length` property to `0`, the array is truncated to an empty array.
- Therefore, after setting `arr.length = 0`, `arr` becomes `[]`.

### Output:
```js
console.log(arr); // Output: []
```

So, the output will be an empty array `[]`.
