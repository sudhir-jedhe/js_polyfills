The table you provided compares the `slice()` and `splice()` methods in JavaScript, and the key differences are accurately highlighted. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each point, with some additional details:

| **Slice** | **Splice** |
|-----------|------------|
| **Doesn't modify the original array (immutable)** | **Modifies the original array (mutable)** |
| `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array without modifying the original array. The original array remains unchanged. | `splice()` modifies the original array by removing, replacing, or adding elements in place. |
| **Returns the subset of the original array** | **Returns the deleted elements as an array** |
| `slice()` returns a new array containing the selected portion of the original array. It does not alter the original array. | `splice()` returns an array containing the elements that were removed. If no elements were removed, it returns an empty array. |
| **Used to pick the elements from the array** | **Used to insert/delete elements to/from the array** |
| `slice()` is typically used when you want to extract a part of the array (a subset) based on the provided start and end indices. | `splice()` is used when you need to modify the array by removing elements, adding new elements, or replacing existing ones. |

### Detailed Explanation:

#### **1. Immutability vs Mutability**

- **`slice()`**:
  - The `slice()` method does **not** modify the original array. Instead, it returns a new array containing the selected elements. The original array remains unchanged, which makes `slice()` **immutable**.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const newArr = arr.slice(1, 3); // [2, 3]
  console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (original array is unchanged)
  ```

- **`splice()`**:
  - The `splice()` method **modifies** the original array by removing, replacing, or adding elements. It directly alters the array and is **mutable**.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const removedElements = arr.splice(1, 2); // Removes 2 elements starting from index 1
  console.log(arr); // [1, 4] (original array is modified)
  console.log(removedElements); // [2, 3] (the removed elements)
  ```

#### **2. Return Values**

- **`slice()`**:
  - Returns a new array that contains the elements from the original array, starting from the given `start` index to the `end` index (exclusive).
  - If no elements are selected, it returns an empty array.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
  const subset = arr.slice(1, 3); // [20, 30]
  console.log(subset);
  ```

- **`splice()`**:
  - Returns an array containing the elements that were removed from the original array. If no elements are removed, it returns an empty array.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
  const removed = arr.splice(1, 2); // Removes 2 elements from index 1
  console.log(arr); // [10, 40] (array is modified)
  console.log(removed); // [20, 30] (removed elements)
  ```

#### **3. Use Cases**

- **`slice()`** is used when you want to:
  - Extract a portion of an array without changing the original array.
  - Create a shallow copy of a part of the array.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
  const copiedArr = arr.slice(1, 3); // ['b', 'c']
  console.log(copiedArr);
  ```

- **`splice()`** is used when you want to:
  - Remove elements from an array, insert new elements, or replace existing elements.
  - Modify the original array in place.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  arr.splice(2, 1, 'a', 'b'); // Removes 1 element at index 2 and inserts 'a' and 'b'
  console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 'a', 'b', 4]
  ```

### Summary:

- **`slice()`**: Does not modify the original array and returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.
- **`splice()`**: Modifies the original array by removing, replacing, or adding elements and returns the removed elements.
