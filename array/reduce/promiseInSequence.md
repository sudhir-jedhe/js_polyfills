The code you've provided demonstrates how to execute multiple promises in sequence, meaning one promise will start only after the previous one has finished. Here's an explanation of how it works:

### Key Elements:
1. **Helper function `asyncTask(i)`**:
   This function simulates an asynchronous task that resolves after a certain period of time, which depends on the input `i`. Each task's resolution time increases proportionally to `i`. The `setTimeout` function is used to simulate asynchronous behavior, and the promise is resolved after that timeout.

   ```javascript
   const asyncTask = function(i) {
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         setTimeout(() => resolve(`Completing ${i}`), 100 * i);
       });
   }
   ```

   For example:
   - If `i = 3`, the promise will resolve after 300ms.

2. **Creating an Array of Promises (`promises`)**:
   An array of tasks (promises) is created by calling `asyncTask(i)` with different values.

   ```javascript
   const promises = [
     asyncTask(3),
     asyncTask(1),
     asyncTask(7),
     asyncTask(2),
     asyncTask(5),
   ];
   ```

   Each task is executed after its corresponding delay (e.g., 300ms for `asyncTask(3)`).

3. **Executing Promises in Sequence with `asyncSeriesExecuter`**:
   The `asyncSeriesExecuter` function ensures that the promises in the `promises` array are executed in sequence. It uses `reduce()` to chain the promises, with each promise waiting for the previous one to resolve before executing the next one.

   ```javascript
   const asyncSeriesExecuter = function(promises) {
     promises.reduce((acc, curr) => {
       // Return the next promise after the previous one resolves
       return acc.then(() => {
         // Run the current promise and log the value
         return curr.then(val => { console.log(val); });
       });
     }, Promise.resolve()); // Initialize with a resolved promise
   };
   ```

   - The `reduce()` method accumulates the promises one by one.
   - The `acc` is the accumulated promise, starting with `Promise.resolve()`, which is already resolved and ensures the sequence begins immediately.
   - For each `curr` (current promise), we call `then()` on the accumulator (`acc`), ensuring the current promise only starts after the previous one finishes.

4. **Running the function**:
   When `asyncSeriesExecuter(promises)` is called, it executes each task in the sequence. The order of execution depends on the initial order of promises in the `promises` array. It logs the result of each task one by one after the delay.

### Example Output:
```javascript
"Completing 3"
"Completing 1"
"Completing 7"
"Completing 2"
"Completing 5"
```

### How it Works:
- `asyncTask(3)` takes 300ms to complete, then logs `"Completing 3"`.
- `asyncTask(1)` takes 100ms to complete, then logs `"Completing 1"`.
- `asyncTask(7)` takes 700ms to complete, then logs `"Completing 7"`, and so on.

By chaining promises in sequence with `reduce()`, the execution order is controlled, ensuring that each task completes before the next one starts.
