This is a simple implementation of the `reduce` function, where you pass an array (`nums`), a reducer function (`fn`), and an initial value (`init`), and it performs the reduction (i.e., accumulates a result).

Here is the explanation and the code you provided:

### Code Explanation:

1. **`customReduce` Function:**
   - It takes three arguments:
     - `nums`: The array of numbers to reduce.
     - `fn`: The reducer function that will be applied to each element.
     - `init`: The initial value of the accumulator.
   - It initializes the `result` variable to the `init` value.
   - Then, it loops through each element of the `nums` array (`for...of` loop), applying the reducer function (`fn`) and updating the `result` with the new value returned by the reducer function.
   - Finally, it returns the accumulated `result`.

2. **Example:**
   - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`: The array of numbers you want to reduce.
   - `reducer`: The function that takes two arguments, the current accumulated value and the current value from the array. It adds them together in this case.
   - `initialValue = 0`: The initial value of the accumulator.

3. **Calling `customReduce`:**
   - The `customReduce(nums, reducer, initialValue)` is called to sum the numbers in the `nums` array. The result of this reduction is `15`, which is logged to the console.

### Final Code:

```javascript
// customReduce.js
export function customReduce(nums, fn, init) {
  let result = init;

  for (let num of nums) {
    result = fn(result, num);
  }

  return result;
}

// main.js
import { customReduce } from "./customReduce.js";

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue;
const initialValue = 0;

console.log(customReduce(nums, reducer, initialValue)); // Output: 15
```

### Output:

```javascript
15
```

The `customReduce` function works similarly to JavaScript's native `reduce` method, summing the elements of the array and producing the final result of `15`.
