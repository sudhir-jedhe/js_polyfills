Both implementations of the `longestIncreasingSubsequence` (LIS) function are correct and provide valuable solutions, but they differ in their approaches. Here's a detailed comparison and explanation of each one:

### **First Implementation (Length of LIS)**

```javascript
function longestIncreasingSubsequence(nums) {
    if (!nums.length) return 0; // Empty array has LIS of length 0
  
    const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(1); // Initialize DP table with 1s (LIS ending at each index)
  
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
          dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1); // Consider including current element if it's increasing
        }
      }
    }
  
    // Maximum value in DP table represents LIS length
    return Math.max(...dp);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(longestIncreasingSubsequence([10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18])); // Output: 4
console.log(longestIncreasingSubsequence([0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3])); // Output: 4
console.log(longestIncreasingSubsequence([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7])); // Output: 1
```

#### **Explanation:**
- This approach uses **dynamic programming (DP)** to solve the problem.
- The idea is to maintain a `dp` array, where `dp[i]` stores the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at index `i`.
- For each number `nums[i]`, it looks for previous numbers `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) and checks if `nums[i] > nums[j]`. If true, it updates `dp[i]` as the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` (considering extending the subsequence ending at `j`).
- The final answer is the maximum value in the `dp` array, which gives the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n²)**: The nested loops iterate over each pair of indices in the array, making it a quadratic solution. `n` is the length of the input array.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(n)**: The `dp` array has the same size as the input array.

#### **Example Outputs:**
- For `[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]`, the LIS length is 4, corresponding to the subsequence `[2, 3, 7, 101]`.
- For `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`, there is no increasing subsequence, so the LIS length is 1.

### **Second Implementation (Actual LIS Sequence)**

```javascript
function longestIncreasingSubsequence(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return [];
    
    const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(1);
    const sequences = new Array(nums.length).fill(null).map(() => []); // Store actual subsequences
    let maxLength = 1;
    let endIndex = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sequences[i].push(nums[i]);
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i] && dp[i] < dp[j] + 1) {
                dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
                sequences[i] = [...sequences[j], nums[i]]; // Update the subsequence
            }
        }
        if (dp[i] > maxLength) {
            maxLength = dp[i];
            endIndex = i; // Track the end index of the LIS
        }
    }
    
    return sequences[endIndex]; // Return the actual LIS sequence
}

// Example usage:
console.log(longestIncreasingSubsequence([10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18])); // Output: [2, 3, 7, 101]
console.log(longestIncreasingSubsequence([0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3])); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3]
console.log(longestIncreasingSubsequence([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7])); // Output: [7]
```

#### **Explanation:**
- This approach is similar to the first one, but instead of just storing the LIS length at each index, it also tracks the actual subsequences.
- The `sequences` array stores the subsequence itself ending at each index. When `dp[i]` is updated, the corresponding subsequence is also updated by extending the subsequence ending at `j` with `nums[i]`.
- At the end of the process, the `sequences` array contains the longest increasing subsequences ending at each index, and the subsequence corresponding to the maximum length is returned.

#### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(n²)**: Just like the first implementation, the solution still uses nested loops to compare pairs of elements.
- The time complexity is dominated by the nested loop structure.

#### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(n²)**: In addition to the `dp` array, we also store the subsequences themselves in the `sequences` array, which can be up to quadratic in size due to the fact that the subsequences may each be of length `n`.

#### **Example Outputs:**
- For `[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]`, the LIS sequence is `[2, 3, 7, 101]`.
- For `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`, the LIS sequence is `[7]`, as all the elements are equal.

### **Comparison:**

1. **Goal**:
   - The **first implementation** only returns the length of the LIS.
   - The **second implementation** returns the actual subsequence itself.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Both solutions have the same time complexity of **O(n²)** because they both use a dynamic programming approach with nested loops to compare each element with the previous ones.
   - The second implementation is slightly more memory-intensive because it stores the actual subsequences in the `sequences` array.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Use the **first implementation** if you only care about the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence.
   - Use the **second implementation** if you need the **actual subsequence** and not just the length.

4. **Space Complexity**:
   - The **first implementation** is more space-efficient (**O(n)**) because it only needs the `dp` array to track the lengths.
   - The **second implementation** is more space-heavy (**O(n²)**) due to the `sequences` array, which stores the actual subsequences.

---

### **Conclusion**:

- **Use the first implementation** if you're only interested in the **length of the LIS** and need a more space-efficient solution.
- **Use the second implementation** if you need to **retrieve the actual longest increasing subsequence**, and you're willing to trade some extra space for it.
