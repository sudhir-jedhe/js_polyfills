The custom implementation of the `customShift` method for arrays you provided is a good example of how you can replicate the built-in JavaScript `shift()` method manually. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the built-in behavior.

### **Custom `customShift` Method Explanation:**

#### **Code Breakdown:**

```javascript
Array.prototype.customShift = function () {
    if (this.length === 0) {
      // Return undefined if the array is empty
      return undefined;
    }
    // Save the first element
    const shiftedElement = this[0];
    // Shift the remaining elements to the left
    for (let i = 0; i < this.length - 1; i++) {
      this[i] = this[i + 1];
    }
    // Remove the last element (now a duplicate) and update the length
    this.length--;
    return shiftedElement;
};
```

1. **Empty Array Check:**
   - If the array is empty (`this.length === 0`), it returns `undefined`, mimicking the built-in `shift()` behavior.
   
2. **Shifting Elements:**
   - The first element is saved (`const shiftedElement = this[0]`).
   - Then, we shift all the remaining elements one position to the left. This is done in the `for` loop, where each element at index `i` is replaced by the element at index `i + 1`. So, for example:
     - `this[0] = this[1]`
     - `this[1] = this[2]`, and so on.
   
3. **Updating Length:**
   - After shifting the elements, the last element (which is now a duplicate of the second-to-last element) is removed by reducing the `length` property of the array by one (`this.length--`).

4. **Returning Shifted Element:**
   - Finally, the method returns the first element that was shifted out, just like the built-in `shift()` method.

#### **Example Usage:**

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
const shiftedFruit = fruits.customShift();
console.log(shiftedFruit); // Output: 'apple'
console.log(fruits); // Output: ['banana', 'orange']
```

Here:
- `"apple"` is removed from the array and returned.
- The array is updated to `['banana', 'orange']`.

### **Built-in `shift()` Example:**

The following example uses the built-in `shift()` method:

```javascript
const words = ["hello", "world"];
const el1 = words.shift();
console.log(el1); // Output: 'hello'
console.log(words); // Output: ['world']
```

- The first element (`"hello"`) is removed and returned.
- The array is updated to `['world']`.

If you run this code with an **empty array**:

```javascript
const words = [];
const el1 = words.shift();
console.log(el1); // Output: undefined
console.log(words); // Output: []
```

- The result is `undefined` because there were no elements to shift.
- The array remains empty.

---

### **Summary:**

- Your custom `customShift` method correctly replicates the behavior of JavaScript's built-in `shift()` method, with a few caveats:
  - **Time Complexity:** The method has a time complexity of **O(n)** due to the loop that shifts each element in the array to the left.
  - **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** since it modifies the array in place and only stores a single value (`shiftedElement`).

Both the custom and built-in `shift()` methods handle the case of an empty array and return `undefined` when there are no elements to remove. Your implementation is effective for small arrays, but keep in mind that with larger arrays, the time complexity of shifting elements one by one may impact performance.

### **Example with an empty array:**

For an empty array, both implementations will return `undefined`:

```javascript
const words = [];
const el1 = words.customShift();
console.log(el1); // Output: undefined
console.log(words); // Output: []
```

In conclusion, your custom method works as expected and mimics the behavior of JavaScript's built-in `shift()`.
