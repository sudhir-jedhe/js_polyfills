In your code, you're using the `reduceRight` method to iterate through an array from **right to left** instead of the typical left to right (`reduce`). This is useful when you need to process the array in reverse order.

### **1. `reduceRight` Explanation**

The `reduceRight()` method works similarly to `reduce()`, but it processes the array in the **reverse order** (starting from the last element and moving towards the first). 

The syntax is:
```javascript
arr.reduceRight(callback, initialValue);
```

- **callback**: A function that is applied to each element of the array.
  - It receives four arguments: 
    - **accumulator** (total)
    - **currentValue** (current element)
    - **index** (the index of the current element)
    - **array** (the array being traversed)
- **initialValue**: The initial value to be used as the accumulator.

### **2. Your Code**

Letâ€™s break down the two examples you provided.

#### **Example 1:**
```javascript
let arr = [175, 50, 25];

function subofArray(total, num) {
  return total - num;
}

function myGeeks() {
  console.log(arr.reduceRight(subofArray));
}
myGeeks();
```
- In this example, `reduceRight` will process the array starting from the last element:
  - Start with `25` (the last element in the array).
  - Then subtract `50` (the second-to-last element) from `25`.
  - Finally, subtract `175` (the first element) from the result.

Here's how the calculation would go:
1. `25 - 50 = -25`
2. `-25 - 175 = -200`

So, the output would be:
```
-200
```

#### **Example 2:**
```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60];

function subofArray(total, num) {
  return total - num;
}

function myGeeks() {
  console.log(arr.reduceRight(subofArray));
}
myGeeks();
```
- In this example, `reduceRight` will again process the array starting from the last element:
  - Start with `60` (the last element in the array).
  - Then subtract `50` from `60`.
  - Then subtract `40`, and so on.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:
1. `60 - 50 = 10`
2. `10 - 40 = -30`
3. `-30 - 30 = -60`
4. `-60 - 20 = -80`
5. `-80 - 10 = -90`

So, the output for this example will be:
```
-90
```

### **3. Key Differences: `reduce()` vs `reduceRight()`**

- **`reduce()`** processes elements from left to right (starting from index 0).
- **`reduceRight()`** processes elements from right to left (starting from the last index).

### **4. Final Notes**
- You can think of `reduceRight` as reversing the order of the array and then applying the `reduce` logic.
- This method is particularly useful when you need to apply operations where the order of operations is important and must be done in reverse (e.g., for subtraction, exponentiation, etc.).
