### Explanation of the `productExceptSelf` function

The problem asks for an array where each element at index `i` is the product of all elements in the input array except the element at index `i`.

We can solve this problem efficiently without using division and in `O(n)` time complexity by utilizing two passes over the array. 

Here's the detailed breakdown of both versions of the `productExceptSelf` function:

### Approach 1: Using Left and Right Arrays

The first solution uses two auxiliary arrays (`left` and `right`) to store the cumulative product of elements to the left and right of the current element, respectively.

#### Steps:
1. **Create two auxiliary arrays** (`left` and `right`), both initialized with 1.
2. **Calculate the left products**: For each element, calculate the product of all elements to its left and store it in the `left` array.
3. **Calculate the right products**: For each element, calculate the product of all elements to its right and store it in the `right` array.
4. **Multiply left and right products** for each index to get the final result.

#### Code:

```javascript
function productExceptSelf(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const left = new Array(n).fill(1);  // Left product array
    const right = new Array(n).fill(1); // Right product array
    const result = new Array(n);

    // Calculate left products
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        left[i] = left[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
    }

    // Calculate right products
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        right[i] = right[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
    }

    // Calculate final result
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result[i] = left[i] * right[i];
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(productExceptSelf([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
console.log(productExceptSelf([-1, 1, 0, -3, 3])); // Output: [0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
```

#### Output:

```javascript
[24, 12, 8, 6]
[0, 0, 9, 0, 0]
```

### Approach 2: Optimized Solution (Using a Single Result Array)

In the second version, we optimize the space complexity by using a single result array to store both the left and right products. This avoids the need for two separate arrays for left and right products.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize the result array** with 1s.
2. **First pass (left products)**: Traverse the array from left to right. For each index `i`, update the result array such that `result[i]` contains the product of all elements to the left of `i`.
3. **Second pass (right products)**: Traverse the array from right to left. Update the result array such that `result[i]` is multiplied by the product of all elements to the right of `i`.
4. Return the final result array.

#### Code:

```javascript
function productExceptSelf(nums) {
    const result = new Array(nums.length).fill(1); // Initialize result array with 1s

    // Calculate the product of all elements to the left of each index (excluding itself)
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        result[i] = result[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
    }

    // Calculate the product of all elements to the right of each index (excluding itself)
    let rightProduct = 1;
    for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        result[i] *= rightProduct;
        rightProduct *= nums[i];
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(productExceptSelf([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
console.log(productExceptSelf([0, 1, 2, 3])); // Output: [0, 0, 0, 0] (product is 0 for elements with 0)
```

#### Output:

```javascript
[24, 12, 8, 6]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Time and Space Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity**: Both approaches have a time complexity of **O(n)** because we make two passes over the array (one for left products and one for right products).
   
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - **First approach**: **O(n)** space for `left`, `right`, and `result` arrays.
   - **Second approach**: **O(n)** space for the `result` array, but no extra space for `left` and `right` arrays, making it more space-efficient.

### Conclusion:

- If you are aiming for clarity, **Approach 1** might be better, but it uses more space.
- If you need a space-optimized solution, **Approach 2** is the way to go because it only uses the `result` array and performs the computation in two passes.

Both approaches ensure that we don't use division and maintain an **O(n)** time complexity.
