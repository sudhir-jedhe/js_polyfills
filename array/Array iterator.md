Here is the code you provided, formatted in Markdown along with an explanation:

```javascript
// Function to create a custom range iterator
function makeRangeIterator(start = 0, end = Infinity, step = 1) {
  let nextIndex = start;
  let iterationCount = 0;

  const rangeIterator = {
    next() {
      let result;
      if (nextIndex < end) {
        result = { value: nextIndex, done: false }; // Return current value and continue iteration
        nextIndex += step; // Increment the next index by step
        iterationCount++; // Count the iterations
        return result;
      }
      return { value: iterationCount, done: true }; // Return the total iteration count when done
    },
  };
  return rangeIterator;
}

// Create an iterator from 1 to 10, stepping by 2
const iter = makeRangeIterator(1, 10, 2);

let result = iter.next(); // Get the first result from the iterator
while (!result.done) {
  console.log(result.value); // Output: 1 3 5 7 9
  result = iter.next(); // Move to the next value
}

console.log("Iterated over sequence of size:", result.value); // Output: 5 numbers returned (size of the sequence)
```

### Explanation:

1. **`makeRangeIterator` Function**:
   - **Purpose**: This function creates an iterator that generates a sequence of numbers from a start value to an end value with a specified step.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `start`: The starting value (default is `0`).
     - `end`: The end value (default is `Infinity`).
     - `step`: The step increment between values (default is `1`).
   - **Logic**: 
     - It initializes `nextIndex` to the `start` value.
     - The `next()` method generates the next value in the sequence, increments the `nextIndex` by the `step` value, and tracks the number of iterations.
     - When the end of the sequence (`nextIndex >= end`) is reached, it returns the total number of iterations, and the iteration is marked as done (`done: true`).

2. **Iterator Usage**:
   - `iter.next()` is called in a loop to get the next value in the sequence until the iteration is finished (i.e., `done` is `true`).
   - The `console.log(result.value)` prints each value in the sequence.
   - Once the iteration is done, `console.log("Iterated over sequence of size:", result.value)` outputs the number of iterations (i.e., the number of valid values that were generated).

### Example Output:

For the input:
```javascript
const iter = makeRangeIterator(1, 10, 2);
```
The output will be:
```bash
1
3
5
7
9
Iterated over sequence of size: 5
```

### Key Concepts:
- **Custom Iterator**: We created a custom iterator to iterate through a range with a flexible start, end, and step.
- **State Tracking**: The iterator tracks both the current index (`nextIndex`) and the number of iterations (`iterationCount`).
- **Iterator Protocol**: The iterator object follows the JavaScript iterator protocol, where the `next()` method returns an object with `value` and `done` properties.

This approach demonstrates how to create a custom iterator in JavaScript, which can be useful for various use cases where you need a custom sequence generation.
