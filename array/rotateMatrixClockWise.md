Your implementation for rotating matrices both clockwise and anticlockwise is correct. Let's break down each of the functions for clarity and consider optimizations if needed.

### **Clockwise Rotation (`rotateMatrixClockWise`)**

The clockwise rotation is achieved by moving the elements in a specific pattern:

1. The **top-left** elements are rotated to the **top-right**.
2. The **top-right** elements are moved to the **bottom-right**.
3. The **bottom-right** elements are moved to the **bottom-left**.
4. The **bottom-left** elements are moved to the **top-left**.

Each of these moves happens in a nested loop to handle all the layers of the matrix.

Here is the code:

```javascript
const rotateMatrixClockWise = (arr, N = arr.length) => {
    for (let x = 0; x < N / 2; x++) {
        for (let y = x; y < N - x - 1; y++) {
            // Store the left value
            let temp = arr[x][y];
            
            // Move values from left to top 
            arr[x][y] = arr[N - 1 - y][x];
            
            // Move values from top to right 
            arr[N - 1 - y][x] = arr[N - 1 - x][N - 1 - y];
            
            // Move values from right to bottom 
            arr[N - 1 - x][N - 1 - y] = arr[y][N - 1 - x];
            
            // Move values from bottom to left 
            arr[y][N - 1 - x] = temp;
        }
    }

    return arr;
};

// Example input
const arr = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15, 16]
];

console.log(rotateMatrixClockWise(arr));
```

### **Explanation of Steps**:

1. The outer loop (`for (let x = 0; x < N / 2; x++)`) loops over the layers of the matrix. For a 4x4 matrix, there are 2 layers to rotate (the outer and the inner layer).
2. The inner loop (`for (let y = x; y < N - x - 1; y++)`) iterates over the elements in each layer.
3. The `temp` variable stores the original value of the top-left element, and the other steps rotate the matrix elements in the four directions, clockwise.

### **Input and Output**:

Input:

```javascript
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12],
  [13, 14, 15, 16]
]
```

Output:

```javascript
[
  [13, 9, 5, 1],
  [14, 10, 6, 2],
  [15, 11, 7, 3],
  [16, 12, 8, 4]
]
```

### **Anti-Clockwise Rotation (`rotateMatrixAntiClockWise`)**

The anti-clockwise rotation works in a similar manner but with different directional swaps:

1. The **top-left** elements are moved to the **bottom-left**.
2. The **bottom-left** elements are moved to the **bottom-right**.
3. The **bottom-right** elements are moved to the **top-right**.
4. The **top-right** elements are moved to the **top-left**.

Here's the code for anti-clockwise rotation:

```javascript
const rotateMatrixAntiClockWise = (arr, N = arr.length) => {
    for (let x = 0; x < N / 2; x++) {
        for (let y = x; y < N - x - 1; y++) {
            // Store the right value
            let temp = arr[x][y];

            // Move values from right to top 
            arr[x][y] = arr[y][N - 1 - x];
            
            // Move values from bottom to right 
            arr[y][N - 1 - x] = arr[N - 1 - x][N - 1 - y];
  
            // Move values from left to bottom 
            arr[N - 1 - x][N - 1 - y] = arr[N - 1 - y][x];
 
            // Assign temp to left 
            arr[N - 1 - y][x] = temp;
        }
    }

    return arr;
};

// Example input
const arrAntiClockwise = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15, 16]
];

console.log(rotateMatrixAntiClockWise(arrAntiClockwise));
```

### **Explanation of Steps**:

1. The outer loop (`for (let x = 0; x < N / 2; x++)`) loops over the layers, similar to the clockwise rotation.
2. The inner loop (`for (let y = x; y < N - x - 1; y++)`) iterates over the elements in each layer.
3. The `temp` variable stores the original value of the top-left element, and the other steps rotate the matrix elements in the four directions, anti-clockwise.

### **Input and Output**:

Input:

```javascript
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12],
  [13, 14, 15, 16]
]
```

Output:

```javascript
[
  [4, 8, 12, 16],
  [3, 7, 11, 15],
  [2, 6, 10, 14],
  [1, 5, 9, 13]
]
```

### **Summary**:

- Both functions rotate the matrix in different directions: clockwise and anti-clockwise.
- The approach you’ve used is efficient, as it modifies the matrix **in-place** without creating additional matrices, and it works for any `N x N` matrix (assuming a square matrix).
- The overall time complexity is **O(N²)**, as we are iterating through every element in the matrix, which is optimal for this type of operation.

### **Optimizations**:
- The provided implementations are already optimal in terms of time complexity. However, if you'd like to improve readability or modularity, consider breaking down the rotation logic into smaller helper functions.
