The functions you've provided are excellent implementations of converting an integer to a Roman numeral. Here's a breakdown and explanation of each approach:

### Approach 1: Using an Array of Objects (Detailed Mapping)
This version uses an array of objects to map each Roman numeral symbol to its corresponding value. The algorithm works by iterating through this list of symbols, subtracting the value of each symbol from the number until the number becomes zero.

#### Code:
```javascript
function intToRoman(num) {
    const romanSymbols = [
        { value: 1000, symbol: 'M' },
        { value: 900, symbol: 'CM' },
        { value: 500, symbol: 'D' },
        { value: 400, symbol: 'CD' },
        { value: 100, symbol: 'C' },
        { value: 90, symbol: 'XC' },
        { value: 50, symbol: 'L' },
        { value: 40, symbol: 'XL' },
        { value: 10, symbol: 'X' },
        { value: 9, symbol: 'IX' },
        { value: 5, symbol: 'V' },
        { value: 4, symbol: 'IV' },
        { value: 1, symbol: 'I' }
    ];

    let result = '';
    let remaining = num;

    for (let i = 0; i < romanSymbols.length; i++) {
        const { value, symbol } = romanSymbols[i];

        while (remaining >= value) {
            result += symbol;
            remaining -= value;
        }
        
        if (remaining === 0) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Examples:
console.log(intToRoman(3));       // Output: "III"
console.log(intToRoman(58));      // Output: "LVIII"
console.log(intToRoman(1994));    // Output: "MCMXCIV"
```

#### Explanation:
- The `romanSymbols` array contains objects with a `value` and `symbol`. It starts from the largest value (1000, 'M') and moves down to the smallest (1, 'I').
- The algorithm iterates through the array and checks if the current `remaining` number is greater than or equal to the value of the current symbol.
- If so, it appends the symbol to the result string and reduces the `remaining` number by that value.
- The process repeats until `remaining` becomes zero.

### Approach 2: Using an Array of Arrays (Simplified Mapping)
This version simplifies the mapping by using an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains the Roman numeral symbol and its corresponding value.

#### Code:
```javascript
function intToRoman(num) {
    // Define Roman symbols and their corresponding values
    const symbols = [
      ['M', 1000],
      ['CM', 900],
      ['D', 500],
      ['CD', 400],
      ['C', 100],
      ['XC', 90],
      ['L', 50],
      ['XL', 40],
      ['X', 10],
      ['IX', 9],
      ['V', 5],
      ['I', 1],
    ];
  
    let roman = "";
  
    // Iterate through symbols in descending order of values
    for (const [symbol, value] of symbols) {
      // While the number is greater than or equal to the current symbol's value
      while (num >= value) {
        // Append the symbol to the Roman numeral string
        roman += symbol;
        // Subtract the symbol's value from the number
        num -= value;
      }
    }
  
    return roman;
}
  
// Example usage
const number = 3999;
const romanNumeral = intToRoman(number);
console.log(romanNumeral); // Output: MMMCMXCIX
```

#### Explanation:
- The `symbols` array contains sub-arrays with the Roman numeral symbol and its corresponding value.
- The algorithm iterates through the `symbols` array, checking whether the current `num` is greater than or equal to the current value. If it is, it appends the symbol to the result string and reduces the `num`.
- This process continues until all parts of the Roman numeral are appended.

### Comparison:
Both approaches are almost identical in terms of logic and performance, with the primary difference being the structure used to store the symbol-value pairs. Both solutions use a **greedy algorithm** that repeatedly subtracts the largest possible Roman numeral value until the number is reduced to zero.

- **Approach 1 (Array of Objects)**: Each symbol-value pair is represented as an object, which could be beneficial for more complex scenarios where additional properties might be associated with each symbol.
- **Approach 2 (Array of Arrays)**: The array of arrays is more compact and may be preferable if you want a cleaner structure with minimal syntax, especially when no additional properties are needed.

### Time Complexity:
- Both approaches have a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of Roman numeral symbols, because each iteration processes a number value from the symbols array until the number is fully converted.

### Example Outputs:
1. **For `3`**:
   - Output: `"III"`
2. **For `58`**:
   - Output: `"LVIII"`
3. **For `1994`**:
   - Output: `"MCMXCIV"`
4. **For `3999`**:
   - Output: `"MMMCMXCIX"`

### Additional Thoughts:
If you were to implement this for very large numbers (beyond the typical limits for Roman numerals), you could extend the list of symbols. However, this solution works efficiently for the standard Roman numeral system used in modern contexts.
