### Understanding `Array.prototype.map()` vs. `Array.prototype.forEach()`

`Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.forEach()` are both very commonly used methods in JavaScript, and while they seem similar at first glance, they serve different purposes and behave differently.

#### 1. **`Array.prototype.map()`**
- **Purpose**: `map()` is used to **transform** an array. It applies the provided callback function to each element of the array and returns a **new array** with the results.
- **Return Value**: It **returns a new array**.
- **Use case**: When you want to create a new array where each element is the result of applying a transformation function to each item in the original array.

#### Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
// Returns: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(doubledNumbers);
```

In this example, `map()` doubles each number in the `numbers` array and returns a new array of the transformed values.

#### 2. **`Array.prototype.forEach()`**
- **Purpose**: `forEach()` is used to **iterate** over the array and **perform** a side-effect or action (e.g., logging, modifying a variable outside the array).
- **Return Value**: It **does not return anything** (returns `undefined`).
- **Use case**: When you need to perform some action on each element but do not need to create a new array with the results.

#### Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2));
// Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
```

In this example, `forEach()` iterates through the array and logs each doubled number, but it doesn't return anything. It's used when we just need to perform an action (like logging) but don't need a new array.

### Key Differences

| Feature                        | `Array.prototype.map()`                     | `Array.prototype.forEach()`                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Return Value**                | A new array with transformed values         | `undefined` (doesn't return a value)            |
| **Purpose**                     | To **transform** the array                  | To **iterate** over the array for side-effects  |
| **Modifies the Original Array** | No, it creates a new array                  | No, it doesn't modify the original array        |
| **Usage**                       | When you want to create a new array         | When you want to perform an action on each item |
| **Break/Return Support**        | No way to break/return early                | No way to break/return early                    |

### Which One to Use?

- **Use `map()`** when you want to transform the data and create a new array based on the original array.
- **Use `forEach()`** when you just need to perform some action on each element (such as logging, updating external variables, etc.), but do not need to return a new array.

---

### Example: Use Case for `map()` vs `forEach()`

1. **Transforming Data (`map()`):**
   If you're trying to apply some transformation to the array, such as doubling all values, you should use `map()` because it returns a new array.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
   console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
   ```

2. **Logging Data (`forEach()`):**
   If you only need to log each element or perform an action like sending data to a server, use `forEach()`.

   ```javascript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num * 2)); 
   // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
   ```

### **Performance Consideration:**
- In most cases, both `map()` and `forEach()` are sufficient, but the humble `for` loop might still be more efficient in certain cases, especially if you need to break out of the loop early. For example, you can't break out of a `map()` or `forEach()` early, whereas you can with a `for` loop.

#### Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] === 3) break; // You can break early
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```

### Conclusion:
- Use `map()` when you need to **transform** and return a new array.
- Use `forEach()` when you need to **perform actions** on the elements of an array (such as logging or updating an external variable), but don't need a new array.
