Both of the functions you've written aim to count how many times the digit **1** appears in all numbers from **1** to **n**. The logic of both functions is based on processing each digit of **n** and examining how many times **1** can appear at that digit's position.

### Let's break down the logic:

#### **First Version (Using `Math.floor` to find the current, higher, and lower digits)**

```javascript
function countDigitOne(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    
    let count = 0;
    let factor = 1; // To track the digit positions
    
    while (factor <= n) {
        let current = Math.floor(n / factor) % 10; // Current digit
        let higher = Math.floor(n / (factor * 10)); // Higher digits
        let lower = n % factor; // Lower digits
        
        if (current === 0) {
            count += higher * factor;
        } else if (current === 1) {
            count += higher * factor + lower + 1;
        } else {
            count += (higher + 1) * factor;
        }
        
        factor *= 10;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Factor Tracking:** This keeps track of the digit position, starting from the least significant digit (ones place).
   - Example: Start with `factor = 1`, then `factor = 10`, `factor = 100`, etc.

2. **For each digit position (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.):**
   - **Current digit**: The digit in the current position.
   - **Higher digits**: Digits to the left of the current digit (used to calculate the total number of times `1` appears).
   - **Lower digits**: Digits to the right of the current digit (used to adjust the count for the current position).

3. **Counting Logic:**
   - If the **current digit** is `0`, then the number of times `1` can appear in this digit's place is determined by the number of higher digits.
   - If the **current digit** is `1`, then `1` appears in this position plus the number of possible lower digits, plus `1` for the current digit itself.
   - If the **current digit** is greater than `1`, then all positions in this digit are valid for `1` to appear, so the count is incremented by `higher + 1`.

4. **Factor Update:** Multiply the `factor` by 10 after each iteration to move to the next digit.

#### **Second Version (With `high`, `cur`, and `low` variables)**

```javascript
function countDigitOne(n) {
    let count = 0;
    let digit = 1;
  
    while (digit <= n) {
      const high = Math.floor(n / (digit * 10)); // Count 1s in the high digits (e.g., hundreds, thousands)
      const cur = n % (digit * 10); // Current digit (tens place)
      const low = Math.floor(cur / digit); // Count 1s in the low digits (e.g., ones)
  
      if (cur < digit) {
        count += high * digit; // No 1s in the current digit (tens place)
      } else if (cur === digit) {
        count += high * digit + low + 1; // All 1s in the current digit + remaining low digits + 1 (for the current digit itself)
      } else {
        count += (high + 1) * digit; // All 1s in the current digit and high digits
      }
  
      digit *= 10; // Move to the next digit position (hundreds, thousands, etc.)
    }
  
    return count;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Tracking (`digit`):** This starts at `1` (ones place) and increases by a factor of 10 (tens, hundreds, etc.) after each iteration.

2. **Breaking down the number:**
   - **High**: The higher digits to the left of the current digit.
   - **Cur**: The entire number modulo the current digit place (`digit * 10`), representing the current and lower digits.
   - **Low**: The current digit itself, derived from `cur / digit`.

3. **Counting Logic:**
   - If the **current digit** is less than the `digit`, then `1` cannot appear at this position. We count all the `1`s that can appear in the higher digits (higher * digit).
   - If the **current digit** is exactly `digit`, we count all `1`s in the higher digits and the lower digits, plus one for the current digit itself.
   - If the **current digit** is greater than the `digit`, then `1` can appear in all numbers at this digit's position, including higher digits, so the count is incremented by `(high + 1) * digit`.

4. **Digit Update:** Multiply `digit` by 10 to move to the next position.

### **Examples:**

1. **Example 1 (`countDigitOne(13)`)**
   - The digit `1` appears 6 times in numbers from 1 to 13: `1, 10, 11, 12, 13`.
   
   Both implementations will correctly return `6`.

2. **Example 2 (`countDigitOne(0)`)**
   - There are no numbers from 1 to 0, so the count is `0`.

   Both implementations will correctly return `0`.

3. **Example 3 (`countDigitOne(100)`)**
   - The digit `1` appears 21 times in numbers from 1 to 100. Numbers where `1` appears include `1, 10-19, 21, 31, ..., 91`.

   Both implementations will correctly return `21`.

---

### **Summary of Differences:**

- **First version:** Uses `Math.floor()` to extract the current digit, higher digits, and lower digits.
- **Second version:** Extracts `high`, `cur`, and `low` by dividing and taking modulo with respect to the current digit, but both essentially follow the same logic.

Both functions will give you the correct count of how many times the digit `1` appears in numbers from `1` to `n`. The overall approach and the logic used in both implementations are quite similar, and they work for large inputs efficiently by reducing the problem to each digit place rather than iterating through each number individually.
