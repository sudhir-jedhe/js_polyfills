The problem requires you to find the number of elements in the array that have the **maximum frequency**. In simpler terms:

- First, you need to count how often each number appears in the array.
- Then, you identify the maximum frequency of any number.
- Finally, you count how many elements appear with that maximum frequency.

Let's break down both solutions you provided and optimize or clarify them.

### Solution 1: Using `Map`

```javascript
function countMaxFrequencyElements(nums) {
    // Step 1: Count frequencies using a Map
    const freqMap = new Map();
    for (const num of nums) {
        freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Find the maximum frequency
    let maxFreq = 0;
    for (const freq of freqMap.values()) {
        maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, freq);
    }
    
    // Step 3: Count elements with maximum frequency
    let count = 0;
    for (const freq of freqMap.values()) {
        if (freq === maxFreq) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    // Step 4: Return the count of elements with maximum frequency
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countMaxFrequencyElements([1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]));  // Output: 4
console.log(countMaxFrequencyElements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));    // Output: 5
```

### Explanation:
1. **Step 1**: We create a `Map` called `freqMap` to store the frequencies of each element.
2. **Step 2**: We find the **maximum frequency** by iterating over the values of the map.
3. **Step 3**: We count how many times the maximum frequency occurs.
4. **Step 4**: Finally, we return the count of elements with the maximum frequency.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Input**: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]`
  - The frequencies of elements are:
    - `1`: 2 times
    - `2`: 2 times
    - `3`: 1 time
    - `4`: 1 time
  - The **maximum frequency** is `2`, and there are **2 elements** (`1` and `2`) that appear with this frequency. So, the output is `4` (since both `1` and `2` appear twice, giving 4 total occurrences).

### Solution 2: Using Object to Count Frequencies

```javascript
function countElementsWithMaxFrequency(nums) {
    const count = {};
    let maxFrequency = 0;
  
    // Count frequencies of elements
    for (const num of nums) {
      count[num] = (count[num] || 0) + 1;
      maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, count[num]); // Update max frequency
    }
  
    // Count elements with maximum frequency
    let maxCount = 0;
    for (const frequency in count) {
      if (count[frequency] === maxFrequency) {
        maxCount++;
      }
    }
  
    return maxCount;
}
  
// Example usage
const nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4];
const result = countElementsWithMaxFrequency(nums);
console.log(result); // Output: 4
```

### Explanation:
1. **Counting Frequencies**: We use a regular object `count` to store the frequency of each number.
2. **Find Maximum Frequency**: As we iterate, we simultaneously track the **maximum frequency**.
3. **Count Elements with Max Frequency**: We then iterate over the `count` object and check how many elements have the maximum frequency.
4. **Return the Result**: We return the total count of numbers that appear with the maximum frequency.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Input**: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]`
  - The frequencies of elements are:
    - `1`: 2 times
    - `2`: 2 times
    - `3`: 1 time
    - `4`: 1 time
  - The **maximum frequency** is `2`, and there are **2 elements** (`1` and `2`) that appear with this frequency. So, the output is `4`.

### Simplification and Efficiency:

Both solutions are correct, but the first solution (using `Map`) is more flexible and efficient, especially when it comes to handling different data types. The second solution using an object works perfectly for integer arrays and is simpler for small use cases.

- **Time Complexity**: Both solutions have a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array, since both involve iterating through the array once to count frequencies and another time to find the maximum frequency and count how many elements have that frequency.

- **Space Complexity**: Both solutions also have a space complexity of **O(n)**, since we store the frequency of each element in either a `Map` or an object.

---

### Final Optimized Solution:

If you prefer a cleaner solution with less code duplication and better readability, here's an optimized approach using a `Map`:

```javascript
function countMaxFrequencyElements(nums) {
    const freqMap = new Map();
  
    // Count frequencies of elements
    for (const num of nums) {
      freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
  
    // Find the maximum frequency
    const maxFreq = Math.max(...Array.from(freqMap.values()));
  
    // Count how many elements have the maximum frequency
    return Array.from(freqMap.values()).filter(freq => freq === maxFreq).length;
}
  
// Example usage:
console.log(countMaxFrequencyElements([1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]));  // Output: 4
console.log(countMaxFrequencyElements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));    // Output: 5
```

### Explanation of Optimized Solution:
1. **Count Frequencies**: We use the `Map` to count occurrences of each number.
2. **Find Maximum Frequency**: We use `Math.max()` on the `values` of the map to get the maximum frequency.
3. **Count Elements with Max Frequency**: We use `Array.from()` and `filter()` to count how many elements have the maximum frequency.

This solution is slightly more concise while maintaining the same time complexity and clarity.
