// This is a common JavaScript interview question.
// It tests one's knowledge about checking for the array type,
// looping through an array, various native methods such as Array.prototype.concat,
// and recursion.

// Clarification Questions
// What type of data does the array contain? Some approach only applies to certain data types.
// How many levels of nesting can this array have? If there are thousands-of-levels of nesting, recursion might not be a good idea given its big upfront memory footprint.
// Should we return a new array or we mutate the existing array?
// Can we assume valid input, i.e. an array. Normally the answer is "yes", so you don't have to waste your time doing defensive programming.
// Does the environment the code runs on has ES6+ support? The environment determines what methods/native APIs you have access to
