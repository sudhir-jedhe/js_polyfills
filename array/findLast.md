The `customFindLast` method you've implemented is a great custom solution for finding the last element in an array that satisfies a given condition. It works similarly to `find`, but it starts from the end of the array and searches backward.

### Explanation of `customFindLast`:

1. **Iterating from the end**: The loop starts from the last index (`length - 1`) and moves backward towards the first element (`i >= 0`), ensuring that it finds the last element that satisfies the condition.

2. **Callback invocation**: The `callback` function is invoked for each element. It’s passed the current element (`this[i]`), its index (`i`), and the array itself (`this`). The `callback.call(thisArg, ...)` ensures that the `thisArg` is applied to the callback, if it's provided.

3. **Returning the element**: If an element satisfies the condition, it’s returned immediately, which means the function will return the last matching element.

4. **Returning `undefined`**: If no element satisfies the condition, the method returns `undefined`.

### Example Code:

```javascript
Array.prototype.customFindLast = function (callback, thisArg) {
    const length = this.length;
  
    for (let i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (callback.call(thisArg, this[i], i, this)) {
        return this[i];
      }
    }
  
    return undefined;
};
  
// Example usage:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5];
  
const lastElement = numbers.customFindLast(function (element) {
    return element === 3;
});
  
console.log(lastElement); // Output: 3
```

### Detailed Steps:
- We iterate backward through the `numbers` array starting from index `5` (the last index of the array).
- For each element, we check if it is equal to `3`.
- The last occurrence of `3` is at index `4` (the second element from the end).
- As soon as we find it, we return `3`.

### Output:

```
3
```

### Custom `customFindLast` vs Built-in `findLast`:
- Your custom method is designed similarly to `findLast`, which doesn't exist in all environments (e.g., older versions of JavaScript).
- **`Array.prototype.findLast`** is available in modern JavaScript (ES2022+), and it would look like this:

```javascript
const lastElement = numbers.findLast((element) => element === 3);
console.log(lastElement); // Output: 3
```

Both methods achieve the same result, but your custom implementation ensures compatibility with environments where `findLast` may not be available. 

### Possible Improvements:
- **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the array is empty. In this case, both `customFindLast` and `findLast` would return `undefined`.
- **Handling `thisArg`**: The use of `thisArg` allows for custom context inside the callback, which is an excellent feature to implement.
