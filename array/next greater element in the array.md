You're trying to solve the problem of finding the next greater element for each element in an array. In your solution, you have two approaches: a brute force method and an optimized method using a stack.

### **1. Brute Force Approach (Original Code)**

In this approach, for each element in the array, you search for the next greater element by comparing it with every element to its right. This results in a time complexity of **O(n^2)**, which is inefficient for larger arrays.

Here's your brute force approach with some corrections:

```javascript
let nextGreater = (arr, n = arr.length) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    let next = -1;

    // Find the next greater element
    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (arr[i] < arr[j]) {
        next = arr[j];
        break;
      }
    }

    console.log(next);  // Output the next greater element
  }
};

// Example usage:
nextGreater([4, 5, 2, 25]);
// Output: 
// 5
// 25
// 25
// -1
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Outer Loop (`i`)**: For each element in the array, you're searching for the next greater element.
2. **Inner Loop (`j`)**: You start from the next element (`j = i + 1`) and search for the first greater element than `arr[i]`.
3. If a greater element is found, it’s printed as the next greater element; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

**Time Complexity**: **O(n²)** due to the nested loops. It works, but for large arrays, this solution will be slow.

### **2. Optimized Approach Using a Stack**

The stack-based approach is much more efficient. By using a stack, you can reduce the time complexity to **O(n)**.

Here's an optimized solution using a stack:

```javascript
let nextGreaterWithStack = (arr, n = arr.length) => {
  let stack = [];  // Use a stack to store elements
  let next;

  // Traverse the array
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    next = arr[i];
    
    // Check for elements in the stack that have a smaller value than the current element
    while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] < next) {
      let element = stack.pop();  // Pop the smaller element from the stack
      console.log(`${element} ---> ${next}`);  // The current element is the next greater element for the popped element
    }

    // Push the current element to the stack
    stack.push(next);
  }
  
  // After processing all elements, for remaining elements in the stack, print -1 as their next greater element
  while (stack.length > 0) {
    let element = stack.pop();
    console.log(`${element} ---> -1`);
  }
};

// Example usage:
nextGreaterWithStack([4, 5, 2, 25]);
// Output:
// 4 ---> 5
// 5 ---> 25
// 2 ---> 25
// 25 ---> -1

nextGreaterWithStack([11, 13, 21, 3]);
// Output:
// 11 ---> 13
// 13 ---> 21
// 21 ---> -1
// 3 ---> -1
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Stack**: The stack stores elements while you're processing the array. The stack helps in keeping track of elements for which you need to find the next greater element.
2. **Inner While Loop**: Whenever a smaller element (stack top) is found in the stack compared to the current element, it's popped from the stack, and the current element is considered the "next greater element" for the popped element.
3. **Push to Stack**: If the current element doesn't have a next greater element yet (i.e., it’s smaller than the element at the top of the stack), push it to the stack for later comparisons.
4. **Remaining Stack**: After processing all elements, the remaining elements in the stack don't have any greater element to their right, so they get a `-1`.

**Time Complexity**: **O(n)** because each element is pushed and popped from the stack only once.

### **Comparison**:
- The brute force approach has a time complexity of **O(n²)**, which is fine for small inputs but inefficient for large arrays.
- The stack-based approach optimizes this to **O(n)**, making it a much better solution for large datasets.

**Recommended Approach**: Use the **stack-based approach** for optimal performance.
