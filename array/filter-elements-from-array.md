The solution you provided for the problem of filtering elements from an array without using the built-in `Array.filter()` method looks solid! Let's break down the code and explain it in detail.

### Problem Understanding:
You are given an array `arr` and a filtering function `fn`. Your goal is to return a new array `filteredArr` containing only the elements from `arr` where the condition defined by `fn(arr[i], i)` evaluates to `true`. 

- `fn` can accept two arguments:
  1. `arr[i]`: The value of the current element.
  2. `i`: The index of the current element.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Truthy and Falsy Values**: The function `fn` should return truthy values (like non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, `true`, etc.) to include the corresponding element in the filtered array.
2. **Without using `Array.filter()`**: You need to manually implement the filtering logic without using JavaScript's built-in `filter()` method.

### Your Code:

```javascript
var filter = function(arr, fn) {
    let filteredArr = [];

    // Loop through the array using a for-in loop (works for indices as well).
    for (const i in arr) {
        // Apply the filter condition using fn and include the item if it's truthy.
        if (fn(arr[i], Number(i))) {
            filteredArr.push(arr[i]);
        }
    }

    // Return the new filtered array.
    return filteredArr;
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `filteredArr` is initialized as an empty array to hold the filtered elements.

2. **Looping through the array**:
   - We use a `for...in` loop to iterate over the array. The loop gives us the index `i` as the key, and we can access `arr[i]` to get the value.
   - We use `Number(i)` because `i` is a string by default in a `for...in` loop, and we want to make sure we pass the correct numeric index to the `fn` function.

3. **Applying the filter function**:
   - Inside the loop, we apply the `fn(arr[i], Number(i))` condition. If it returns `true` (truthy value), we push the current element (`arr[i]`) to the `filteredArr`.

4. **Return the filtered array**:
   - Finally, the filtered array `filteredArr` is returned, which contains only the elements for which `fn` returned a truthy value.

### Example Walkthroughs:

#### Example 1:

```javascript
const arr = [0, 10, 20, 30];
const fn = function greaterThan10(n) { return n > 10; };
console.log(filter(arr, fn));  // Output: [20, 30]
```

- In this case, `fn` filters out numbers that are not greater than 10. The output is `[20, 30]` because only those values satisfy `n > 10`.

#### Example 2:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const fn = function firstIndex(n, i) { return i === 0; };
console.log(filter(arr, fn));  // Output: [1]
```

- Here, `fn` filters out all elements except the one at index `0`. So, the output is `[1]` since only that value satisfies `i === 0`.

#### Example 3:

```javascript
const arr = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2];
const fn = function plusOne(n) { return n + 1; };
console.log(filter(arr, fn));  // Output: [-2, 0, 1, 2]
```

- In this case, `fn` adds `1` to each element. The condition is to only keep truthy values. Since `0` is falsy, it gets filtered out. The output is `[-2, 0, 1, 2]`.

### Considerations:
- **Edge Cases**: The code works with empty arrays as well because an empty array will simply return an empty `filteredArr`.
  
### Performance:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we loop over each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) because, in the worst case, all elements are added to the `filteredArr`.

### Summary:
Your implementation is correct and solves the problem efficiently. It effectively replicates the behavior of `Array.filter()` using a custom approach. This solution works well with various filtering functions that take both values and indices into account.
