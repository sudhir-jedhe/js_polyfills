The problem you're tackling is to find the smallest possible number that can be formed using the digits of a given number, with the condition that the transformed number should not start with a 0 (unless the number itself is 0).

Let's walk through the two different approaches and their code.

### Approach 1: Sorting and Handling Leading Zeroes

This approach works by:
1. Splitting the number into its individual digits.
2. Sorting the digits in ascending order.
3. Checking if the first digit after sorting is 0 and swapping the first non-zero digit with the first 0 to avoid leading zeroes.

Here is the code:

```javascript
function smallestPossibleNumber(num) {
    // Create a character array and sort it
    let sorted = num.split('').sort();
    
    // Check if the first character is not '0'
    if (sorted[0] !== '0') {
        return sorted.join('');  // Return the sorted number if no leading zero
    }

    // Find the index of the first non-zero character
    let index = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < sorted.length; i++) {
        if (sorted[i] > '0') {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Swap the indexes (first 0 with first non-zero)
    let temp = sorted[0];
    sorted[0] = sorted[index];
    sorted[index] = temp;

    // Return the string after joining the characters of the array
    return sorted.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(smallestPossibleNumber('55010'));  // Output: "10055"
console.log(smallestPossibleNumber('7652634')); // Output: "2345667"
console.log(smallestPossibleNumber('000001'));  // Output: "100000"
console.log(smallestPossibleNumber('000000'));  // Output: "000000"
```

### How it works:

1. **Splitting and Sorting**: The number is split into its digits and sorted in ascending order. For example:
   - `55010` becomes `['0', '0', '1', '5', '5']` after sorting.
2. **Leading Zero Handling**: If the sorted number starts with 0, the first non-zero digit is swapped to the beginning. This ensures that the final number doesn't start with a leading zero unless the number is zero.
   - After sorting `55010`, the sorted array is `['0', '0', '1', '5', '5']`. The first non-zero element `1` is swapped with `0` to ensure the result starts with a non-zero number.
3. **Return the Result**: The sorted and possibly adjusted array is joined back into a string and returned.

### Approach 2: Frequency Counting and Rebuilding the Number

This approach uses a frequency array to count how many times each digit appears, and then builds the smallest number possible:

```javascript
function smallestPossibleNumber(num) { 
    // Initialize frequency of each digit to Zero
    let freq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]; 
    
    // Count frequency of each digit in the number
    while (num > 0){ 
        let d = parseInt(num % 10); // Extract last digit
        freq[d]++; // Increment the frequency count        
        num = parseInt(num / 10); // Remove last digit
    } 

    // Set the LEFTMOST digit to minimum except 0
    let result = 0; 
    for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) { 
        if (freq[i] !== 0) { 
            result = i;  // Set the first non-zero digit
            freq[i]--;   // Decrease its count
            break;
        } 
    }

    // Arrange the remaining digits in ascending order
    for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
        while (freq[i]-- !== 0) { 
            result = result * 10 + i; 
        }
    }
   
    return result; 
}

// Example usage:
console.log(smallestPossibleNumber(55010));  // Output: 10055
console.log(smallestPossibleNumber(7652634)); // Output: 2345667
console.log(smallestPossibleNumber(000001));  // Output: 1
console.log(smallestPossibleNumber(000000));  // Output: 0
```

### How it works:

1. **Frequency Counting**: The digits of the number are counted using a frequency array. For example:
   - `55010` gives the frequency array: `[2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (there are two `0`s, one `1`, and two `5`s).
2. **Find the Leftmost Non-zero Digit**: The algorithm starts by finding the first non-zero digit to avoid a leading zero. It then subtracts the count of that digit by 1 and adds it to the result.
3. **Arrange Remaining Digits**: The remaining digits are added to the result in ascending order based on their frequency count.
4. **Return the Result**: The number is reconstructed and returned.

### Comparison:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Approach 1 (Sorting): O(n log n) due to sorting.
  - Approach 2 (Frequency Counting): O(n) where `n` is the number of digits, since we only loop over the digits and the frequency array.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - Approach 1 (Sorting): O(n) for storing the digits as a list.
  - Approach 2 (Frequency Counting): O(1) for the fixed-size frequency array (only 10 digits to track).

### Conclusion:

- If the number is large and performance is a concern, **Approach 2** (Frequency Counting) is more efficient.
- **Approach 1** (Sorting) is simpler and easier to understand, but less optimal for large inputs due to the sorting step. 

Both approaches correctly handle the problem of generating the smallest possible number without leading zeros.
