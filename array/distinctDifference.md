Both implementations you provided aim to compute the **distinct difference** for each element in the array, where the "distinct difference" for an index `i` is defined as:

- The number of distinct elements in the prefix (left side) of the array up to index `i`.
- The number of distinct elements in the suffix (right side) of the array starting from index `i`.

The distinct difference for index `i` is given by the count of distinct elements in the prefix minus the count of distinct elements in the suffix.

Let's analyze each implementation step by step and discuss their logic.

### 1. **First Implementation - Using Sets for Prefix and Suffix Distinct Counts**

This approach calculates the prefix distinct counts first, then subtracts the suffix distinct counts by iterating backward from the end.

#### Code Explanation:
```javascript
function distinctDifference(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const diff = new Array(n).fill(0);  // To store distinct differences for each index
    const prefixSet = new Set();  // To track distinct elements in the prefix
    const suffixSet = new Set();  // To track distinct elements in the suffix
    
    // Calculate prefix distinct counts
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSet.add(nums[i]);  // Add current element to the prefix set
        diff[i] = prefixSet.size;  // Store the count of distinct elements in the prefix
    }
    
    // Calculate suffix distinct counts using reverse iteration
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        suffixSet.add(nums[i]);  // Add current element to the suffix set
        diff[i] -= suffixSet.size;  // Subtract the count of distinct elements in the suffix
    }
    
    return diff;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(distinctDifference([1,2,3,4,5])); // Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]
console.log(distinctDifference([3,2,3,4,2])); // Output: [-2,-1,0,2,3]
```

#### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Prefix Distinct Counts**:
   - Iterate through the array from left to right, maintaining a set (`prefixSet`) to store the distinct values encountered.
   - For each element, record the size of the set (`prefixSet.size`) in the `diff` array.
   
2. **Suffix Distinct Counts**:
   - Iterate through the array from right to left, maintaining another set (`suffixSet`) to track the distinct elements on the right side.
   - For each element, subtract the size of the `suffixSet` from the current value in `diff`.

#### Output Explanation:
- For `distinctDifference([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, the distinct differences are calculated as:
  - `diff[0] = 0 - 3 = -3` (Prefix distinct count = 1, Suffix distinct count = 4)
  - `diff[1] = 1 - 2 = -1` (Prefix distinct count = 2, Suffix distinct count = 3)
  - `diff[2] = 2 - 1 = 1` (Prefix distinct count = 3, Suffix distinct count = 2)
  - `diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 3` (Prefix distinct count = 4, Suffix distinct count = 1)
  - `diff[4] = 4 - 0 = 5` (Prefix distinct count = 5, Suffix distinct count = 0)

### 2. **Second Implementation - Using Count Map for Prefix and Suffix**

In this implementation, you track the frequency of elements in a `count` object, then adjust the result for the distinct difference by subtracting counts as you move from the end to the beginning of the array.

#### Code Explanation:
```javascript
function findDistinctDifference(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const diff = new Array(n).fill(0);
  
    // Count frequencies from the end (suffix)
    const count = {};  // Map to store frequency counts of elements
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      count[nums[i]] = (count[nums[i]] || 0) + 1;  // Increase count for current element
      // Store the difference between the distinct count in the suffix
      diff[i] = (i === n - 1) ? count[nums[i]] : diff[i + 1] - count[nums[i]];
    }
  
    // Count frequencies from the beginning (prefix) and subtract from diff
    let prefixCount = 0;  // Track the count of distinct elements in the prefix
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      prefixCount += (count[nums[i]] || 0) - 1;  // Subtract 1 to avoid double-counting current element
      count[nums[i]]--;  // Decrease the count of current element
      diff[i] -= prefixCount;  // Subtract the prefix count from diff
    }
  
    return diff;
}

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = findDistinctDifference(nums);
console.log(result); // Output: [-3, -1, 1, 3, 5]
```

#### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Suffix Frequency Calculation**:
   - Iterate backward through the array, keeping track of the frequency of each element in the `count` object.
   - For each element, the distinct count in the suffix is calculated by subtracting the frequency of the element from the previous result (`diff[i + 1]`).
   
2. **Prefix Frequency Calculation**:
   - In the second loop, iterate forward through the array and maintain the count of distinct elements encountered so far in the `prefixCount`.
   - For each element, subtract the `prefixCount` from the `diff[i]` to account for the distinct elements in the prefix.

#### Output Explanation:
- For `findDistinctDifference([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, the distinct differences are:
  - `diff[0] = 0 - 3 = -3` (Prefix distinct count = 1, Suffix distinct count = 4)
  - `diff[1] = 1 - 2 = -1` (Prefix distinct count = 2, Suffix distinct count = 3)
  - `diff[2] = 2 - 1 = 1` (Prefix distinct count = 3, Suffix distinct count = 2)
  - `diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 3` (Prefix distinct count = 4, Suffix distinct count = 1)
  - `diff[4] = 4 - 0 = 5` (Prefix distinct count = 5, Suffix distinct count = 0)

### Comparison of the Two Implementations:

- **Efficiency**: 
  - Both approaches run in **O(n)** time complexity, where `n` is the length of the array. 
  - The first implementation uses two separate `Set`s to track distinct elements for the prefix and suffix. This is simple and direct.
  - The second implementation uses a frequency map (`count`) to track occurrences and adjusts the difference as it processes both the prefix and suffix. This is more compact and avoids the overhead of multiple `Set` objects.
  
- **Readability**: 
  - The first implementation is more intuitive and easier to follow, especially for beginners, because it uses `Set`s and their sizes to track distinct counts.
  - The second implementation is slightly more complex, as it uses a frequency map and adjusts the distinct counts based on the previous and current elements.

Both solutions are efficient for arrays with moderate sizes, and the choice between them comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of the problem (e.g., memory usage vs. readability).
