It looks like you're implementing a function called `_rest`, which is designed to mimic the behavior of `Array.prototype.slice()` but for the "rest" of the array after a given index. This is essentially what `_.rest` does in libraries like **Lodash**.

### **Explanation:**
The function `_rest` takes two parameters:
1. `list`: The array (or array-like object) from which to extract the "rest" of the elements.
2. `number`: The index from which to begin extracting the elements. If `number` is not provided, it defaults to `1`, which means the first element will be excluded.

The function uses `Array.prototype.slice` to extract all elements starting from the provided index onward. If no index is provided, it starts from index `1`, effectively removing the first element.

### **Code Breakdown:**

```javascript
const slice = Array.prototype.slice; // Grab slice method from Array.prototype

function _rest(list, number) {
    return slice.call(list, number || 1); // Use slice with list and number or 1 as default
}

module.exports = _rest;  // Export _rest function to make it usable elsewhere
```

### **How It Works:**
1. `slice.call(list, number || 1)` invokes `slice` with `list` (which can be an array or array-like object) and the starting index. If `number` is not provided, it defaults to `1` (so it skips the first item).
2. The `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the elements from `list`, starting from index `number` onward.

### **Examples:**

```javascript
const _rest = require('./rest');  // Assuming _rest function is in rest.js file

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(_rest(arr));  // [2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(_rest(arr, 2));  // [3, 4, 5]
```

### **In Comparison to Other Functions:**
The `_.rest` method in Lodash or Underscore works similarly:
- Lodash: `_.rest([1, 2, 3])` returns `[2, 3]`
- Underscore: `_.rest([1, 2, 3])` returns `[2, 3]`

This is effectively the "rest" of the array after the first element (or any specified number of elements).

### **Note:**
- The function works for both real arrays and array-like objects (such as `arguments` in functions).
- It's a simple utility to extract the "rest" of an array without modifying the original array.
