The concept you're discussing is to enable negative index access on JavaScript arrays. JavaScript does not natively support negative indices like Python, but using a `Proxy` object, we can intercept access to array elements and modify the behavior to handle negative indices. 

Let's break it down step by step and explain how we can implement this using a `Proxy`:

### Key Concepts:

1. **Proxy Object**: The `Proxy` object allows you to define custom behavior for fundamental operations on an object, such as property lookup, assignment, and function invocation. In our case, we're defining a custom behavior for the `get` operation (i.e., when accessing an element of the array).

2. **Handler**: The `handler` object contains traps, which define how operations on the target array should be handled. In this case, the `get` trap intercepts property access and modifies the behavior to support negative indices.

3. **Negative Index Logic**: When a negative index is accessed, the value is calculated by adding the negative index to the array's `length`. For example, `arr[-1]` will access the last element, `arr[-2]` the second-to-last element, and so on.

4. **Reflect**: The `Reflect` API provides methods for performing operations on objects. It's used to handle the default behavior of the `get` operation, such as retrieving the value of an object property. 

### Code Explanation:

Here's the code with comments to explain each part:

```javascript
// Define the handler for the Proxy
const handler = {
  // 'get' trap for intercepting property access
  get(target, key, receiver) {
    const index = Number(key);  // Convert the key to a number (since it's a string)
    
    // If the index is negative, calculate the correct index from the end of the array
    const prop = index < 0 ? `${target.length + index}` : key;
    
    // Use Reflect to get the value at the calculated index (either negative or positive)
    return Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver);
  },
};

// Function to create an array with Proxy
const createArray = (...elements) => {
  const arr = [...elements];  // Create an array with the provided elements
  return new Proxy(arr, handler);  // Return a Proxy for the array
};

// Example usage:
let arr = createArray('a', 'b', 'c');

console.log(arr[-1]); // Output: 'c' (last element)
console.log(arr[-2]); // Output: 'b' (second-to-last element)
console.log(arr[-3]); // Output: 'a' (first element)
```

### How it Works:

1. **Proxy**: The `createArray` function creates a new array and wraps it in a `Proxy`. The `handler` object is provided to customize the behavior of array element access.

2. **Negative Index Handling**: The `get` trap checks if the index is negative. If it is, it adds the negative index to the array's `length` to get the correct position in the array. For example:
   - If `index === -1`, it becomes `arr.length + (-1)` which is the last element.
   - If `index === -2`, it becomes `arr.length + (-2)` which is the second-to-last element, and so on.

3. **Reflect.get()**: After determining the correct index (whether it's positive or negative), the `Reflect.get()` method is called to fetch the actual value from the array.

### Example Outputs:

```javascript
let arr = createArray('a', 'b', 'c');

console.log(arr[-1]); // Output: 'c' (the last element)
console.log(arr[-2]); // Output: 'b' (second-to-last element)
console.log(arr[-3]); // Output: 'a' (first element)
```

### Conclusion:
By using the `Proxy` object, we've successfully implemented negative index access for arrays. This is a powerful feature in JavaScript, allowing us to access elements from the end of an array using negative indices (similar to how it's done in Python).
