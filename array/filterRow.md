Your `filterRows` function looks great and correctly implements a basic filtering mechanism. Let's break down how it works and confirm the logic:

### Function Breakdown:

1. **filterRows Function**:
   - It takes two parameters:
     - `data`: An array of objects where each object represents a row (in this case, each row has a `name` and `age`).
     - `requirement`: A callback function that determines the condition for filtering. This function takes a `row` as an argument and should return `true` if the row meets the condition, or `false` otherwise.

2. **Filtering Logic**:
   - It loops over each `row` in `data`.
   - If the `requirement(row)` callback returns `true`, the row is added to the `filteredRows` array.
   - After the loop, `filteredRows` is returned, containing all the rows that passed the filter condition.

### Example Usage:

You're using it with a dataset `data` consisting of people, and filtering rows based on the `age` property:

```javascript
const data = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Carol", age: 27 },
];

// Filter the data to only include rows where the age is greater than 25.
const filteredRows = filterRows(data, (row) => row.age > 25);

// Print the filtered rows.
console.log(filteredRows);
```

### Output:

The output will be:

```javascript
[
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Carol", age: 27 }
]
```

### How it works:
- The filtering condition `(row) => row.age > 25` ensures that only rows where the `age` is greater than 25 are included.
- The rows with `Bob` and `Carol` meet this condition, while `Alice` does not because her age is 25.

### Code Improvements:
The function works perfectly fine, but you can slightly optimize it for readability or flexibility by:
- **Renaming the variables** for clarity, e.g., `requirement` could be renamed to `predicate` to match standard terminology.
- **Using `filter` method**: You could also rewrite the function using the native `Array.prototype.filter()` for brevity, though your implementation is just fine.

Here's how that could look:

### Refactored Version using `filter()`:

```javascript
function filterRows(data, predicate) {
  return data.filter(predicate);
}

const data = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { name: "Carol", age: 27 },
];

// Filter the data to only include rows where the age is greater than 25.
const filteredRows = filterRows(data, (row) => row.age > 25);

console.log(filteredRows);
// [{ name: "Bob", age: 30 }, { name: "Carol", age: 27 }]
```

This version uses the `filter` method directly on `data`, which internally handles the iteration and condition checking.

### Conclusion:
Your implementation is correct and functional. You can use either your original version or the refactored version depending on your preference and coding style. Both approaches achieve the same result effectively!
