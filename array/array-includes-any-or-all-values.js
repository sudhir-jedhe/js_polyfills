Check if a JavaScript array includes any or all values in another array

As discussed previously, you can use Array.prototype.includes() to check if an array includes a specific value. However, what if you want to check if an array includes any or all values in another array? The solution to this problem is just as simple.

Check if an array includes any values
Given an array of values, we want to check if at least one of those values is included in another array, arr. We can do this by using Array.prototype.some() and Array.prototype.includes(). This way we can check each value in values against arr and return true if at least one of them is included.

const includesAny = (arr, values) => values.some(v => arr.includes(v));

includesAny([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 9]); // true
includesAny([1, 2, 3, 4], [8, 9]); // false
Check if an array includes all values
Changing the condition to check if all values are included in arr is simply a matter of swapping Array.prototype.some() for Array.prototype.every(). The same logic as before applies, except now we want to return true if all values are included.

const includesAll = (arr, values) => values.every(v => arr.includes(v));

includesAll([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4]); // true
includesAll([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5]); // false

These snippets might perform poorly for rather large arrays. If you're working with large arrays, you might want to consider using a Set for improved performance.
