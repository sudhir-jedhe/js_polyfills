// 1️⃣ Development: This is where the magic begins! We code, create branches, and collaborate on GitHub. It's like building with digital Lego blocks.

// 2️⃣ Peer Review: No developer is an island. We share our code, give feedback, and run automated checks. It's like having a team of friendly editors for your code!

// 3️⃣ QA Testing: Our QA heroes rigorously test the code. They're the taste-testers of the software world, ensuring everything is just right before it goes live.

// 4️⃣ Pre-Production: Think of this as our dress rehearsal. We load balance, perform final checks, and ensure everything is perfect in a near-real-world environment.

// 5️⃣ Production: Liftoff! We deploy to the cloud (hello, AWS!) and our code starts making an impact in the real world.

// 6️⃣ Continuous Improvement: The journey never ends. We're constantly monitoring, backing up, and seeking ways to enhance our processes and products.
