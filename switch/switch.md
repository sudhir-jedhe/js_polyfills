To avoid the syntax error caused by redeclaring variables in a `switch` block, you can create a new block scope within each `case` by using curly braces `{}`. This allows each `let` or `const` declaration to be scoped to the individual `case` block, preventing the redeclaration error.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Problematic Code:
If you try to redeclare the same variable (`name` in this case) within different `case` clauses without using block scopes, you will get a **SyntaxError**:

```javascript
let counter1 = 1;
switch (x) {
  case 0:
    let name;  // This is okay in case 0
    break;

  case 1:
    let name;  // SyntaxError: redeclaration of 'name'
    break;
}
```

This throws an error because the `switch` block is treated as a single lexical scope, and `let` or `const` variables cannot be redeclared in the same scope.

### Solution: Create a New Block Scope for Each Case

To fix this, you can wrap the contents of each `case` clause in its own set of curly braces `{}`, which creates a new block scope for the variables inside:

```javascript
let counter = 1;
switch (x) {
  case 0: {
    let name;  // Scoped to case 0
    break;
  }
  
  case 1: {
    let name;  // Scoped to case 1, no redeclaration error
    break;
  }
}
```

### Explanation:

- Each `case` now has its own block scope due to the curly braces `{}` around the statements inside.
- The `let` declaration inside each `case` is **limited to that case**, so there's no conflict or redeclaration issue between `case 0` and `case 1`.
- This approach allows you to use the same variable name (`name`) in different `case` clauses without causing a **syntax error**.

### Why It Works:
- `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined.
- By using curly braces `{}` inside each `case`, you're creating new lexical environments, and the `name` variable in `case 0` is entirely different from the `name` variable in `case 1`, even though both are named `name`.

### Summary:

To avoid redeclaration errors in a `switch` block, use curly braces `{}` inside each `case` to create new block-scoped environments for your variables. This will ensure that you can declare the same variable name in different `case` blocks without any conflicts.
