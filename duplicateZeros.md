The function you've implemented `duplicateZeros` seems correct and works as expected for duplicating zeros in an array while maintaining the same array length. However, there are a few things worth mentioning and improving in terms of performance and understanding.

### **Explanation of Code:**

#### **Steps Taken in `duplicateZeros`:**
1. **While Loop**: You iterate through the array with an index `i`.
2. **Zero Check**: When a zero is encountered at `arr[i]`, a new zero is inserted at that position using `arr.splice(i, 0, 0)`.
3. **Pop Last Element**: After inserting the zero, the last element is removed with `arr.pop()`, ensuring the array length remains the same.
4. **Skip Next Zero**: After inserting the duplicated zero, we skip the next element (which would also be zero, due to the duplication) by incrementing `i` by 2.
5. **Move Forward**: If no zero is found at `arr[i]`, just move to the next element by incrementing `i` by 1.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

For the input `arr = [1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0]`:

- The first zero is found at index 1. A new zero is inserted at index 1, and the array becomes `[1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5]`.
- After removing the last element, it becomes `[1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4]`.
- The index is incremented by 2, and we continue to the next zero found at index 4. Another zero is inserted, and the array becomes `[1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0]`.
- The last element is removed, and the index is adjusted accordingly.
- The final result is `[1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4]`.

### **Potential Improvements & Considerations:**

- **Time Complexity**: The current implementation uses `splice` and `pop`, which are relatively expensive operations. `splice` is O(n) for shifting elements, and `pop` is O(1). In the worst case, if zeros are frequently inserted, this can result in quadratic time complexity, i.e., **O(n²)**.
  
  We can improve the time complexity by avoiding `splice` and manipulating the array directly. Instead of modifying the array during iteration, you can first count how many zeros need to be duplicated, and then move backwards to insert the zeros. This will prevent shifting elements unnecessarily.

### **Optimized Approach:**

```js
export function duplicateZeros(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;
  let zerosToDuplicate = 0;
  
  // Count the number of zeros that need to be duplicated
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === 0) {
      zerosToDuplicate++;
    }
  }

  // Traverse the array backwards and insert duplicated zeros
  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (arr[i] === 0) {
      arr[i + zerosToDuplicate] = 0; // Move the zero to the right position
      zerosToDuplicate--; // Decrease the count of zeros to duplicate
      arr[i + zerosToDuplicate] = 0; // Insert the duplicated zero
    } else {
      arr[i + zerosToDuplicate] = arr[i]; // Move the non-zero element to the right
    }
  }
}
```

### **Explanation of the Optimized Approach:**

1. **Count the Zeros**: First, traverse the array and count how many zeros there are. This helps us figure out how much space we'll need to move elements later.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: We then iterate backward through the array. Starting from the end of the array ensures that when we move elements to the right, we don't overwrite any elements that haven't been processed yet.
3. **Inserting Duplicates**: When a zero is encountered, we insert a duplicate zero and move the remaining elements one place to the right.
4. **Non-Zero Elements**: When a non-zero element is found, it is simply moved to the right, leaving the zero space for potential duplication.

### **Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity**: The optimized solution runs in **O(n)** because we traverse the array twice (once for counting zeros and once for placing elements).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are modifying the array in place without using any additional space.

### **Test Example:**

```js
import { duplicateZeros } from "./duplicateZeros.js";

const arr = [1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0];
duplicateZeros(arr);
console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4]
```

This solution is much more efficient, especially for larger arrays where zeros are frequent. It avoids the costly operations of `splice` and `pop` and performs the task in linear time.
