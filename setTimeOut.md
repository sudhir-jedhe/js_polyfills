Let's break down each of the code snippets and explain how they work:

### 1. **First Snippet: Changing the Function Inside `setTimeout`**

```js
let func = () => {
  console.log(1);
};

setTimeout(() => {
  func = () => {
    console.log(2);
  };
}, 0);

setTimeout(func, 100);
```

#### Explanation:
- Initially, `func` is set to log `1`.
- A `setTimeout` with `0` milliseconds runs, and inside this, `func` is reassigned to log `2`.
- The second `setTimeout` calls `func` after `100ms`, but by that time, `func` has already been reassigned to log `2`.

#### Output:
```
2
```

**Why?**  
- The first `setTimeout` is executed asynchronously, so `func` gets updated to log `2` before the second `setTimeout` is executed.

---

### 2. **Second Snippet: Variable Scope with `let`**

```js
let num;

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  num = i;
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(num);
  }, 100);
}
```

#### Explanation:
- `num` is updated in each loop iteration with `i`, and a `setTimeout` is used to log the value of `num`.
- Since `let` has block scope, each iteration of the loop has its own separate scope, and `num` retains its correct value when the `setTimeout` fires.

#### Output:
```
4
```

**Why?**  
- The `setTimeout` executes after the loop has finished running, so the final value of `num` (which is `4`) is logged.

---

### 3. **Third Snippet: Ordering `setTimeout` with Different Delays**

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(2);
}, 2);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(1);
}, 1);

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(0);
}, 0);
```

#### Explanation:
- `setTimeout` functions are asynchronous, and the timers are placed in the event queue in order.
- Even though the delays are `2`, `1`, and `0`, the actual execution order depends on how the event loop processes the queued tasks.

#### Output:
```
0
1
2
```

**Why?**  
- `setTimeout` with the shortest delay (0ms) executes first. The execution order is determined by the queue, where `setTimeout` calls are executed based on the event loop and the minimum delay being processed first.

---

### 4. **Basic `setTimeout` with Delay**

```js
setTimeout(function(){
  console.log('I will be visible after 1 sec delay');
}, 1000);
```

#### Explanation:
- This sets a delay of `1000ms` (1 second) and then logs the message.

#### Output:
```
I will be visible after 1 sec delay
```

**Why?**  
- The `setTimeout` call simply delays the execution by 1000ms and then executes the provided function.

---

### 5. **Calling a Function with `setTimeout` with Parameters**

```js
let greet = (param1, param2) => {
  console.log(`${param1} is ${param2}`)
}

setTimeout(function(){ greet('Prashant', 'Happy') }, 2000);
```

```js
let greet = (param1, param2) => {
  console.log(`${param1} is ${param2}`)
}

setTimeout(greet, 2000, 'Prashant', 'Happy');
```

#### Explanation:
- Both examples are ways to call the `greet` function with parameters after a delay of `2000ms` (2 seconds).
- In the first example, we explicitly call `greet` within a function inside the `setTimeout`.
- In the second example, we pass `greet` directly to `setTimeout`, followed by the parameters to be passed.

#### Output:
```
Prashant is Happy
```

**Why?**  
- After the 2-second delay, the `greet` function is called with `'Prashant'` and `'Happy'` as parameters.

---

### 6. **Handling `this` in `setTimeout`**

#### Example 1: `this` refers to the global object inside a regular function:

```js
let increment = {
  count: 1,
  start: function(){
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log(++that.count);
    }, 1000)
  }
}

increment.start();
// Output: NaN
```

- **Problem**: The `this` inside the regular function doesn't refer to the object `increment`. This is why `NaN` is printed.
- **Solution**: The workaround was to use a variable `that` to store `this`, and access it inside the `setTimeout`.

#### Example 2: Using `that` to preserve the reference:

```js
let increment = {
  count: 1,
  start: function(){
    var that = this;
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log(++that.count);
    }, 1000)
  }
}

increment.start();
// Output: 2
```

- **Explanation**: By assigning `this` to `that`, we ensure that `this.count` is accessible inside the `setTimeout`.

#### Example 3: Using an Arrow Function (Recommended):

```js
let increment = {
  count: 1,
  start: function(){
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(++this.count);
    }, 1000)
  }
}

increment.start();
// Output: 2
```

- **Explanation**: In the arrow function, `this` refers to the `increment` object, as arrow functions don't have their own `this` but inherit it from the surrounding context.

---

### 7. **Using `clearTimeout` to Cancel Timeout**

```js
let start = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('I just started');
  clearMe();
}, 2000);

let clearMe = () => {
  clearTimeout(start);
}

// Output: "I just started"
```

#### Explanation:
- `setTimeout` is used to delay the execution of a function.
- `clearTimeout` is called to cancel the timeout before it executes.

**Output**:
```
I just started
```

The message is logged because `clearTimeout` doesn't actually cancel the timeout once it's already in progress.

---

### 8. **Using `setTimeout` to Create `setInterval`**

```js
let increment = (num) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
     console.log(num);
     num = num + 1;
     increment(num);  // recursively calls itself
  }, 1000);
}

increment(1);
```

#### Explanation:
- This creates an interval-like behavior by recursively calling `setTimeout` every second.
- This simulates the behavior of `setInterval` using `setTimeout`.

#### Output:
```
1
2
3
4
...
```

**Why?**  
- After each second, the `num` is logged and incremented, and the `increment` function is recursively called with the updated `num`.

---

### **Summary:**
- **setTimeout** executes after a specified delay and can be used in a variety of ways to delay function execution.
- Handling `this` in callbacks can be tricky. Use arrow functions or workarounds like `that = this` to maintain the correct reference.
- You can use `setTimeout` in creative ways, such as simulating `setInterval` or canceling timeouts with `clearTimeout`.
