The task is to return a unique array of tag names in lowercase from a given DOM tree. Let's walk through the different methods and improve the code in each.

### Approach 1: Depth First Search (DFS) Recursion

```javascript
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement} tree
 * @return {string[]}
 */
function getTags(tree) {
    const result = {};
    
    const dfs = (node, result) => {
      if (!node) return; // Stop if the node is null
      result[node.tagName.toLowerCase()] = 1; // Store unique tags in result (as keys)
      
      // Recursively visit each child node
      for (const child of node.children) {
        dfs(child, result);
      }
    };
    
    // Start DFS traversal from the root node
    dfs(tree, result);
    
    // Return the keys of the result object (unique tag names)
    return Object.keys(result);
}
```

### Explanation:

- This is a **Depth First Search (DFS)** approach using recursion. We traverse each node in the DOM tree, store its tag name in a result object, and ensure uniqueness using the object's keys.
- The keys in the result object represent the tag names, and we return these keys as an array.

### Approach 2: TreeWalker API (Iterative)

```javascript
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement} tree
 * @return {string[]}
 */
function getTags(tree) {
    // Create a TreeWalker to traverse the DOM tree
    const treeWalker = document.createTreeWalker(tree, NodeFilter.SHOW_ELEMENT, null, false);
    
    const ans = new Set(); // Use a Set to ensure uniqueness
    let cur = treeWalker.currentNode;
    
    // Iterate over all the elements in the tree
    while (cur) {
      ans.add(cur.tagName.toLowerCase()); // Add the tag name to the set
      cur = treeWalker.nextNode(); // Move to the next node
    }
    
    return Array.from(ans); // Convert the Set to an array and return
}
```

### Explanation:

- The **TreeWalker** API allows us to traverse a tree in an iterative manner.
- We use `NodeFilter.SHOW_ELEMENT` to filter and only show element nodes.
- A **Set** is used to store the tag names, ensuring uniqueness, and then we return the values as an array.

### Approach 3: Iterative DFS using Stack

```javascript
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement} tree
 * @return {string[]}
 */
function getTags(tree) {
    const set = new Set(); // Use a Set to ensure uniqueness
    const stack = [tree]; // Initialize the stack with the root node
    
    while (stack.length > 0) {
      const top = stack.pop(); // Get the last node in the stack
      set.add(top.tagName.toLowerCase()); // Add its tag name to the set
      stack.push(...top.children); // Add its children to the stack for further traversal
    }
    
    return [...set]; // Convert the Set to an array and return
}
```

### Explanation:

- This is an **iterative DFS** approach, implemented using a stack.
- We start with the root node in the stack, and for each node, we add its tag name to a Set. Then, we add its children to the stack for further processing.
- The **Set** ensures that only unique tag names are stored.

### Performance Considerations:

- **Time Complexity**: All three approaches have a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the tree, because we need to visit each element at least once.
- **Space Complexity**: In each case, we store the unique tag names in a Set (or an object in the DFS approach), leading to **O(m)** space complexity, where `m` is the number of unique tag names.

### Conclusion:

- The **recursive DFS** approach (first one) is more elegant and easy to read but uses the call stack for recursion.
- The **TreeWalker API** (second one) is very efficient and also has good browser compatibility.
- The **iterative DFS with stack** (third one) is useful when avoiding recursion or deep call stacks is required.

All of these solutions correctly solve the problem and return a list of unique tag names in lowercase. You can choose any of them depending on your preference or context.
