# Section 7 — GitLab CI/CD — Automate Everything — Practical Implementation

## Introduction

This section automates the deployment flow that was done manually in the previous section.

The pipeline will:

1. build the backend and frontend images
2. push those images to GitLab Container Registry
3. connect to the VPS
4. pull the new images
5. restart the live stack

---

## Practical 1 — Push the project to GitLab

### Objective

Make sure the repository exists in GitLab before the pipeline is introduced.

### The project should now contain

- frontend code
- backend code
- `compose.production.yaml`
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`

### Why this comes first

The pipeline file only has meaning once GitLab can read it from the repository.

---

## Practical 2 — Add the required CI/CD variables in GitLab

### Deployment connection variables

- `DEPLOY_HOST`
- `DEPLOY_USER`
- `DEPLOY_PATH`

### SSH file variables

- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`

### Registry pull variables for the VPS

- `REGISTRY_DEPLOY_USER`
- `REGISTRY_DEPLOY_PASSWORD`

### Optional public port variable

- `PUBLIC_PORT`
  - default can be `80`

### Important handling notes

- sensitive values should be masked and protected where appropriate
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` should be added as a file variable
- `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` should be added as a file variable

### Why this matters

The pipeline should not hardcode private credentials in the repository. Variables let GitLab inject those values securely at runtime.

---

## Practical 3 — Create `.gitlab-ci.yml`

### Objective

Define the full build, push, and deploy automation flow.

### File

`.gitlab-ci.yml`

### Content

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - push
  - deploy

  image: docker:24.0.5-cli

### What this pipeline contains

- a build stage for image creation
- a push stage for publishing images
- a deploy stage for updating the live server

---

## Practical 4 — Understand what the build stage is doing

### Build stage responsibilities

- run Docker inside GitLab CI
- build the backend image
- build the frontend image with `VITE_API_URL=/api`
- save both images as tar files
- publish those tar files as artifacts

### Why the tar files matter

The next stage can reuse the exact built images instead of building again.

---

## Practical 5 — Understand what the push stage is doing

### Push stage responsibilities

- authenticate with GitLab Container Registry
- load the image tar files
- tag them with the full registry image names
- push them to the registry

### Why this stage exists separately

It creates a clean split between “building artifacts” and “publishing artifacts.”

---

## Practical 6 — Understand what the deploy stage is doing

### Deploy stage responsibilities

- install the SSH client
- start `ssh-agent`
- load the SSH private key
- copy the known-hosts file
- generate `.env.production`
- copy deployment files to the VPS
- log the VPS into the registry
- pull the tagged images
- restart the Compose stack

### Why this is useful

The server update is now driven from GitLab instead of being performed manually from a local terminal each time.

---

## Practical 7 — Trigger the pipeline

### Commands

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "add gitlab pipeline"
git push
```

### What to watch in GitLab

- the pipeline starts automatically
- the build stage runs first
- the push stage runs after build succeeds
- the deploy stage runs after push succeeds on the default branch

---

## Practical 8 — Verify the live application after deployment

### Open the live app

- the VPS IP
- or the connected domain

### Confirm the result

- the frontend loads
- the API works
- MongoDB data is still present
- the stack updated through the pipeline

This proves the deployment is no longer manual.

---

## Practical 9 — Understand branch behavior

This pipeline deploys only from the default branch.

That is a sensible beginner-friendly production rule because:

- feature branches should not deploy automatically to production
- the production path stays simple
- the promotion path is easier to reason about

---

## Final outcome

By the end of this section, deployment has moved from manual shell work to a versioned GitLab pipeline.

That is the major shift:

- before -> build, push, and deploy were terminal tasks
- after -> build, push, and deploy are stored as automation in the repository
