# MERN Demo App for Docker Course

This is a **very small MERN app** built specifically as the demo project for your Docker + GitLab CI/CD YouTube course.

## Why this app is intentionally simple
- Docker is the main topic, not app architecture.
- The code is kept small so later Docker sections stay easy to explain.
- No Docker files are included yet.
- No extra utils, services, hooks, or over-engineering.

## App features
- React + Vite + TypeScript frontend
- Express + TypeScript backend
- MongoDB Atlas connection
- Add products
- List products
- Delete products
- Health route for later Docker/Compose checks
