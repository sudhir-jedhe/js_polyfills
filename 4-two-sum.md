You've provided multiple approaches to solve the **Two Sum** problem, where the goal is to find two numbers in the array that sum up to a given target and return their indices.

### 1. **Brute Force Solution**

```javascript
const twoSum1 = function (nums, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) return [i, j];
    }
  }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Idea:** You loop through each pair of elements and check if their sum equals the target.
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n^2)**, because for each element, you have to compare it with every other element in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)**, since no extra data structures are used other than variables for the loop.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(twoSum1([2, 7, 11, 15], 9));  // Output: [0, 1]
```

This solution is straightforward but inefficient for large arrays due to its quadratic time complexity. We can improve it with better approaches.

### 2. **Using JavaScript Objects (Hashmap)**

```javascript
const twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  var obj = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    var n = nums[i];

    if (obj[target - n] >= 0) {
      return [obj[target - n], i];
    } else {
      obj[n] = i;
    }
  }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Idea:** The idea here is to use an object (or hashmap) to store the indices of the numbers youâ€™ve seen so far. For each number, check if the complement (`target - n`) has already been seen.
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, because you only iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(n)**, because you store each number and its index in the object.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9));  // Output: [0, 1]
```

### How it works:
- For `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`, during the iteration:
  1. **i = 0**: `n = 2`, `target - n = 9 - 2 = 7`. The object is `{}` at this point, so we store `obj[2] = 0`.
  2. **i = 1**: `n = 7`, `target - n = 9 - 7 = 2`. We check the object and find that `obj[2]` exists, meaning we have previously seen `2`. Therefore, we return `[obj[2], 1]` or `[0, 1]`.

### 3. **Using `Map` (More Efficient with Better Handling of Key-Value Pairs)**

```javascript
var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  const m = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    const x = nums[i];
    const y = target - x;
    if (m.has(y)) {
      return [m.get(y), i];
    }
    m.set(x, i);
  }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Idea:** This approach is similar to the previous one but uses a `Map` instead of an object. A `Map` has better performance for frequent additions and lookups, and it allows for more flexibility with key types.
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, because you loop through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(n)**, because you store each number and its index in the `Map`.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9));  // Output: [0, 1]
```

### How it works:
- Similar to the object-based solution but now using a `Map` for key-value pairs. The map ensures that the lookup operation (`has()`) and insertion (`set()`) are more efficient, and it avoids potential pitfalls with objects (e.g., issues with non-string keys in JavaScript objects).

### Time and Space Complexity Comparison

| Approach                      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Brute Force (Nested Loops)** | **O(n^2)**       | **O(1)**          |
| **Using Objects (Hashmap)**    | **O(n)**         | **O(n)**          |
| **Using Map**                  | **O(n)**         | **O(n)**          |

- **Brute Force:** **O(n^2)** time complexity, which is inefficient for large arrays.
- **Objects and Map-based solutions:** Both have **O(n)** time complexity, making them much more efficient than the brute force approach.
- **Space Complexity:** All three solutions use **O(n)** space, as they store the elements and their indices.

---

### Conclusion:
- The **Brute Force** approach is simple but inefficient, especially for larger inputs.
- The **Object-based** and **Map-based** approaches both have **O(n)** time complexity, and the **Map-based solution** can be considered more efficient in practice due to its more optimal handling of key-value pairs.
- **Recommended:** For large inputs, the **Map-based solution** is ideal because of its performance and efficient handling of key-value lookups.
