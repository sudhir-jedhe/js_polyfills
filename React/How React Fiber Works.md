Here is the English translation and technical explanation of **How React Fiber Works**.

---

**React Fiber** is the core **reconciliation engine** introduced in React 16. It replaced the older engine known as the **Stack Reconciler**.

The main goal of React Fiber is to enable **incremental rendering**—the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames to keep the UI smooth and responsive.

### 1. Why Was Fiber Needed? (Stack Reconciler vs. Fiber)

* **Old Engine (Stack Reconciler):**
When a large component tree needed to update, React processed the entire update synchronously in a single execution. This locked the browser's main thread. If a user tried to type into an input or click a button while this happened, the page would freeze or stutter (dropped frames).
* **New Engine (React Fiber):**
Fiber allows React to **pause, resume, abort, or reuse work** depending on priority. Instead of blocking the browser, React breaks down rendering tasks and yields control back to the main thread frequently.

### 2. How Fiber Works (The Two Phases)

React Fiber processes updates in two distinct phases:

#### **Phase 1: Render Phase (Asynchronous & Interruptible)**

In this phase, React determines what changes need to be made to the DOM.

1. **Tree Traversal & Diffing:** React compares the current component tree with the updated state/props.
2. **Work Chunking:** Tasks are broken into tiny units of work called **Fiber Nodes**.
3. **Interruptibility:** If higher-priority work comes in (like a button click or keypress), React pauses the render phase, handles the user input first, and then resumes or restarts the rendering work.

#### **Phase 2: Commit Phase (Synchronous & Non-Interruptible)**

1. **DOM Mutation:** React takes the accumulated changes (effects) and applies them directly to the **Real DOM**.
2. **Execution:** Lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` / `componentDidUpdate` or `useLayoutEffect` are executed.
3. This phase runs synchronously to prevent incomplete or broken UI states from flickering on screen.

### 3. Priority-Based Scheduling

Fiber assigns a **Priority Level** to every update so urgent tasks run first:

| Task Type                     | Example                            | Priority Level       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Discrete User Interaction** | Typing into an input, button click | **Immediate / High** |
| **Animation**                 | Smooth visual transitions          | **High**             |
| **Data Fetching**             | Displaying API responses           | **Normal**           |
| **Background Processing**     | Analytics logging, offline caching | **Low / Offscreen**  |

### 4. What is a Fiber Node?

Under the hood, a **Fiber Node** is a plain JavaScript object that represents a component and its state in the component tree.

It contains crucial internal pointers:

* `type` & `key`: Identify the component type and list key.
* `child`, `sibling`, `return`: Pointers that form a linked list structure instead of a recursive call stack (allowing React to pause traversal at any node).
* `pendingProps` & `memoizedProps`: Input data before and after processing.
* `flags` (formerly `effectTag`): Instructions on what needs to happen to the DOM (e.g., `Placement`, `Update`, `Deletion`).

### Summary

Think of React Fiber as a **cooperative multi-tasking scheduler** for UI rendering. By breaking rendering down into a linked list of small fiber nodes, React can pause heavy rendering tasks, prioritize user interactions, and keep web applications running at 60 FPS.
