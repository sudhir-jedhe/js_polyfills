**Micro Frontends**

Micro frontends break down a web app’s UI into smaller, self-contained pieces, each managed by different teams.

**Advantages**:
Decoupled Codebases: Teams can work on separate parts without impacting others.
Independent Development: Teams can develop, test, and deploy their micro frontends independently.
Technology Agnostic: Each micro frontend can use the best-suited tech stack.
Scalability: Individual components can be scaled independently.
Focused Teams: Specialization leads to cleaner code.

**Challenges:**
Integration Complexity: Ensuring seamless user experience requires robust integration.
Performance: Multiple micro frontends can impact loading times.
Shared Dependencies: Coordinating shared resources can be tricky.

**Monorepos**
A monorepo stores multiple projects in a single version control repository.

**Advantages:**
Single Source of Truth: Unified codebase simplifies dependency management.
Simplified Dependencies: Easy access to shared libraries and code.
Consistent Tooling: Uniform build and test systems.
Easier Refactoring: Simplified code reuse and refactoring.
Atomic Commits: Changes affecting multiple projects can be committed together.

**Challenges:**
Scalability: Large repositories can become unwieldy.
Build Times: Longer build times may require better infrastructure.

Each approach has its strengths and challenges, so the right choice depends on your project’s needs and team structure.
