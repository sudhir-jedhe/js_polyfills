*** copy componentDidCatchInHooks.md ***

**No. There is currently no React Hook equivalent to `componentDidCatch()`.**

`componentDidCatch()` is only available in **Class Components** and is used for **Error Boundaries**.

### Class Component Example

```jsx id="d8w7q2"
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    console.error(error, errorInfo);
    this.setState({ hasError: true });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

## Can Functional Components Be Error Boundaries?

**Not directly.**

There is no hook like:

```jsx id="f8q2t1"
// ❌ Does not exist
const [error, setError] = useComponentDidCatch();
```

React does not provide such a hook.

---

## Production Approach

Use a Class-based Error Boundary and wrap functional components with it.

```jsx id="h4s7p9"
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Dashboard />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

---

## Popular Alternative: `react-error-boundary`

The library provides a hook-friendly API for functional components.

```jsx id="u2k9m3"
import { ErrorBoundary } from "react-error-boundary";

function ErrorFallback() {
  return <div>Something went wrong.</div>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
      <Dashboard />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

This is commonly used in modern React applications.

---

## Important Limitation

Error Boundaries catch errors in:

✅ Rendering
✅ Lifecycle methods
✅ Constructors of child components

They do **not** catch:

❌ Event handler errors
❌ Async code (`setTimeout`, `fetch`, promises)
❌ Server-side rendering errors

For those cases, use `try/catch` or promise error handling.

## Interview Answer

> There is no Hook equivalent of `componentDidCatch` in React. Error boundaries can only be implemented using class components. In modern React applications, a common approach is to use a class-based Error Boundary or a library such as `react-error-boundary` to provide error handling around functional components.
