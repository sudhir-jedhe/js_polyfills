Here are answers to the questions about React:

### 1. **Do Hooks replace render props and higher-order components?**
   Yes, Hooks can replace many of the use cases for render props and higher-order components (HOCs). With hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`, you can manage state, side effects, and context in a simpler and more direct way than using render props or HOCs.

### 2. **What is a switching component?**
   A switching component is a component that conditionally renders different components based on the state or props. An example is `React Router's <Switch>`, which renders the first `<Route>` that matches the URL.

### 3. **What are React Mixins?**
   React Mixins were a way to share common functionality between components before React introduced Hooks. They allow you to add methods and properties to multiple components. However, they are now considered legacy and are replaced by Hooks.

### 4. **What are the Pointer Events supported in React?**
   React supports all pointer events, such as `onPointerDown`, `onPointerMove`, `onPointerUp`, `onPointerCancel`, `onPointerEnter`, `onPointerLeave`, `onPointerOver`, `onPointerOut`, and `onGotPointerCapture`.

### 5. **Why should component names start with a capital letter?**
   In React, component names must start with a capital letter because lowercase tag names are considered DOM elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<span>`), while capitalized names are treated as React components.

### 6. **Are custom DOM attributes supported in React v16?**
   Yes, React supports custom DOM attributes. Any non-standard attributes will be added to the DOM element as-is, but they will be prefixed with `data-` in the actual HTML markup.

### 7. **How to loop inside JSX?**
   You can loop through an array of items inside JSX using JavaScript's `map()` function:
   ```jsx
   const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
   return (
     <ul>
       {items.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}
     </ul>
   );
   ```

### 8. **How do you access props in attribute quotes?**
   You can directly use the prop value inside JSX attribute quotes:
   ```jsx
   const MyComponent = ({ label }) => {
     return <div>{label}</div>;
   };
   ```

### 9. **What is React PropType array with shape?**
   `PropTypes.arrayOf` with `PropTypes.shape` is used to validate the structure of an array of objects:
   ```jsx
   MyComponent.propTypes = {
     items: PropTypes.arrayOf(
       PropTypes.shape({
         id: PropTypes.number,
         name: PropTypes.string
       })
     )
   };
   ```

### 10. **How to conditionally apply class attributes?**
   You can conditionally apply class names using template literals or libraries like `classnames`:
   ```jsx
   const buttonClass = isPrimary ? 'btn-primary' : 'btn-secondary';
   return <button className={buttonClass}>Click me</button>;
   ```

### 11. **What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?**
   `React` is the core library that defines the component architecture, while `ReactDOM` is used to render components to the DOM. `ReactDOM` contains methods like `ReactDOM.render()` to mount a React component into the DOM.

### 12. **Why is ReactDOM separated from React?**
   ReactDOM is separated from React for better modularity. React itself is a library for defining components, while ReactDOM is specifically focused on rendering those components to the web DOM.

### 13. **How to use React label element?**
   The `label` element is used for labeling form inputs. You can associate a label with an input using the `htmlFor` attribute:
   ```jsx
   <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
   <input id="username" type="text" />
   ```

### 14. **How to combine multiple inline style objects?**
   You can merge multiple inline style objects using `Object.assign()` or the spread operator:
   ```jsx
   const style1 = { color: 'red' };
   const style2 = { backgroundColor: 'blue' };
   const combinedStyle = { ...style1, ...style2 };

   return <div style={combinedStyle}>Hello</div>;
   ```

### 15. **How to re-render the view when the browser is resized?**
   You can use the `useEffect` hook to listen to the resize event and trigger a re-render:
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     const handleResize = () => {
       // Logic for resizing
     };

     window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);

     return () => {
       window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
     };
   }, []);
   ```

### 16. **How to pretty print JSON with React?**
   You can pretty print JSON using `JSON.stringify` with indentation:
   ```jsx
   const jsonData = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
   return <pre>{JSON.stringify(jsonData, null, 2)}</pre>;
   ```

### 17. **Why can't you update props in React?**
   Props are immutable in React because they are meant to be passed from a parent component to a child component. A child component cannot modify the props, it can only receive them.

### 18. **How to focus an input element on page load?**
   You can use the `useRef` hook to focus an input element on page load:
   ```jsx
   const inputRef = useRef(null);
   useEffect(() => {
     inputRef.current.focus();
   }, []);
   
   return <input ref={inputRef} />;
   ```

### 19. **How can we find the version of React at runtime in the browser?**
   You can find the React version in the browser by checking the global `React` object:
   ```javascript
   console.log(React.version);
   ```

### 20. **How to add Google Analytics for react-router?**
   You can use `react-ga` to track page views with React Router:
   ```jsx
   import ReactGA from 'react-ga';
   import { useEffect } from 'react';
   import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

   ReactGA.initialize('UA-XXXXX-Y');
   
   const PageTracker = () => {
     const location = useLocation();
     useEffect(() => {
       ReactGA.pageview(location.pathname + location.search);
     }, [location]);
   
     return null;
   };
   ```

### 21. **How do you apply vendor prefixes to inline styles in React?**
   React automatically applies vendor prefixes when you use the `style` attribute, but if needed, you can manually add them using the `style` prop:
   ```jsx
   const style = {
     WebkitTransition: 'all 1s',
     MozTransition: 'all 1s'
   };
   ```

### 22. **How to import and export components using React and ES6?**
   Use `import` and `export` to import/export components in React:
   ```jsx
   // Exporting
   export default MyComponent;

   // Importing
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
   ```

### 23. **What are the exceptions for React component naming?**
   The only exceptions are built-in components like `<input>`, `<div>`, `<button>`, etc., which should always start with lowercase letters.

### 24. **Is it possible to use async/await in plain React?**
   Yes, you can use async/await in React components, usually inside `useEffect` or event handlers:
   ```jsx
   const fetchData = async () => {
     const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
     const data = await response.json();
     setData(data);
   };
   ```

### 25. **What are the common folder structures for React?**
   A common folder structure is:
   ```
   src/
     ├── components/
     ├── hooks/
     ├── utils/
     ├── pages/
     ├── services/
     └── App.js
   ```

### 26. **What are the popular packages for animation?**
   Some popular animation libraries for React are:
   - `react-spring`
   - `framer-motion`
   - `react-transition-group`

### 27. **What is the benefit of style modules?**
   CSS Modules help scope styles to the component level, avoiding global style clashes and providing better modularity.

### 28. **What are the popular React-specific linters?**
   Popular React-specific linters include:
   - `eslint-plugin-react`
   - `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`
   - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
