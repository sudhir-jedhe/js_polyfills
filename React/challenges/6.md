Let’s go through the questions step by step, with code examples and explanations.

### 1. **Arrow function and what is the difference apart from syntax?**

An **arrow function** is a more concise way to write function expressions in JavaScript. It is often used for functions that are small or do not require their own `this` binding.

**Differences apart from syntax:**
- **`this` binding:** Arrow functions do not bind their own `this` context. They inherit `this` from the surrounding non-arrow function or context.
- **No `arguments` object:** Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object. They inherit it from the outer function.

```js
// Traditional function
function regularFunc() {
  console.log(this);  // `this` refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode)
}

// Arrow function
const arrowFunc = () => {
  console.log(this);  // `this` is inherited from the surrounding scope
};
```

### 2. **Call, apply, bind (Write down the code for one of them)**

**`call()`** allows you to call a function with a specified `this` value and arguments.

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`${this.greeting}, ${name}`);
}

const person = { greeting: "Hello" };
greet.call(person, "Alice"); // Output: "Hello, Alice"
```

### 3. **Generator Function and write a range Generator function**

A **generator function** is a function that can yield multiple values over time, pausing its execution and resuming later.

```js
function* range(start, end) {
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    yield i;
  }
}

const gen = range(1, 5);
console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
```

### 4. **Real-time example of Generator Functions?**

A real-time example can be pagination in APIs, where you retrieve results in chunks and process them lazily.

```js
function* fetchData(apiData) {
  let index = 0;
  while (index < apiData.length) {
    yield apiData.slice(index, index + 10); // Simulating data chunk retrieval
    index += 10;
  }
}

const apiData = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18];
const dataGen = fetchData(apiData);

console.log(dataGen.next().value);  // [1, 2, 3, ..., 10]
```

### 5. **ES6 Features**

Key **ES6 features** include:
- **Let and const**
- **Arrow functions**
- **Template literals**
- **Destructuring assignment**
- **Spread and rest operators**
- **Classes**
- **Modules**
- **Promises**

### 6. **Spread operator, rest operator, and Object destructuring**

- **Spread Operator:**
```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const newObj = { ...obj, c: 3 };
console.log(newObj); // {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

- **Rest Operator:**
```js
function sum(...args) {
  return args.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
}
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6
```

- **Object Destructuring:**
```js
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name, age); // Alice 30
```

### 7. **Difference between forEach and map?**

- **`forEach()`**: Executes a function on each item but does not return a value.
- **`map()`**: Transforms each item and returns a new array with the transformed values.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.forEach(x => console.log(x * 2));  // No return value
const newArr = arr.map(x => x * 2);
console.log(newArr);  // [2, 4, 6]
```

### 8. **Difference between Object.assign() and Object.create()? Which one mutates the data?**

- **`Object.assign()`**: Copies the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It **mutates** the target object.

```js
const obj1 = { a: 1 };
const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1);
obj2.a = 2;
console.log(obj1.a); // 1 (Object.assign does not mutate the source object)
```

- **`Object.create()`**: Creates a new object, using an existing object to provide the newly created object's `[[Prototype]]`.

```js
const prototype = { greet: () => "Hello" };
const newObj = Object.create(prototype);
console.log(newObj.greet()); // "Hello"
```

### 9. **What is a Promise?**

A **Promise** is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const success = true;
  if (success) resolve("Operation successful");
  else reject("Operation failed");
});

myPromise.then(console.log).catch(console.error);  // "Operation successful"
```

### 10. **Write a function component in React that returns a lazy-loaded Button Component and add Suspense with fallback UI**

```jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const LazyButton = lazy(() => import('./Button'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyButton />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

### 11. **What is Error Boundary, How can we write a separate Error Boundary Component?**

An **Error Boundary** is a component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in the child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI.

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.log(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### 12. **What is Redux, Why Redux, Core principles of Redux?**

**Redux** is a state management library for JavaScript apps. It helps manage and centralize application state. It is based on three core principles:
- **Single source of truth**: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
- **State is read-only**: You can only change the state by dispatching an action.
- **Changes are made with pure functions**: Reducers specify how the state changes in response to actions.

### 13. **Write a basic sum function using Typescript and how do you accept params in either string or number?**

```ts
function sum(a: string | number, b: string | number): number {
  return Number(a) + Number(b);
}
```

### 14. **What are Generics functions in Typescript? Can you write down types?**

**Generics** allow you to write functions or classes that work with any data type.

```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
console.log(identity(1)); // 1
console.log(identity("Hello")); // Hello
```

### 15. **Abstract function means?**

An **abstract function** is a function defined in an abstract class that does not have an implementation. Subclasses must implement the function.

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  abstract sound(): string;
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  sound() {
    return "Woof";
  }
}
```

### 16. **Software Principles (DRY, KISS) how do you implement in your codebase?**

- **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself): Avoid duplicating code. Create reusable functions or components.
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Avoid unnecessary complexity. Write clean and simple code.

```js
// DRY Example: Reusable function
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### 17. **Git hook (pre commit, husky)**

**Git hooks** are scripts that run automatically in response to git events. **Husky** is a tool to manage and configure Git hooks easily.

```bash
npx husky-init
```

### 18. **SOLID Principles**

SOLID is a set of five principles to guide software design:
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

### 19. **Write down test cases? What does beforeEach and beforeAll do?**

```js
describe('Test Suite', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Runs before each test
  });

  beforeAll(() => {
    // Runs before all tests
  });

  test('should add numbers', () => {
    expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
  });
});
```

### 20. **Difference between mock vs spy in testing?**

- **Mock**: Mocks provide a fake implementation of a function.
- **Spy**: Spies track how a function was called without changing its implementation.

### 21. **Explain Testing Pyramid?**

The testing pyramid suggests:
- **Unit tests** at the base (fast, small tests).
- **Integration tests** in the middle.
- **End-to-End tests** at the top (slower, larger tests).

### 22. **Differences between Integration Testing vs End to End testing?**

- **Integration Testing**: Focuses on the interaction between multiple components/modules.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Tests the entire application flow, simulating user actions.

### 23. **Which tool have you used for above of them?**

I’ve worked with tools like Jest, Mocha, Cypress, and Testing Library for testing in React.

### 24. **What do we mean by code coverage? How do you measure code coverage?**

**Code coverage** refers to how much of the code is tested by automated tests. Tools like Jest provide coverage reports.

```bash
jest --coverage
```

### 25. **What

 is meant by OWASP top 10?**

The **OWASP Top 10** is a list of the ten most critical web application security risks.

### 26. **What is meant by CSP, XSS (where do we set these CSP headers? In Client or Server)**

**CSP (Content Security Policy)** helps prevent XSS by restricting sources of content. It is set on the server.

### 27. **What is meant by CORS? (Where do we set them)**

**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows you to request resources from a different domain. It is set on the server.

### 28. **DDD?**

**DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** is a methodology focused on modeling complex software based on the business domain.

### 29. **Performance Optimization**

Examples include:
- **CSS**: Minimize CSS, use `transform` instead of `top`/`left` for animations.
- **JS**: Lazy load assets, use `requestIdleCallback`.

### 30. **What is CRP?**

**CRP (Client-Rendered Pages)** refers to pages that are rendered on the client side.

### 31. **Memory leaks in React? Why do they happen?**

Memory leaks occur when components don’t properly clean up resources (e.g., event listeners, timers). This happens when `componentWillUnmount` is not called or effects are not cleaned up.

### 32. **Promise.all vs Promise.any vs Promise.race?**

- **`Promise.all`**: Resolves when all promises are resolved.
- **`Promise.any`**: Resolves when any promise is resolved.
- **`Promise.race`**: Resolves when the first promise settles.

### 33. **How do you configure typescript in your project?**

Run:
```bash
npx tsc --init
```

### 34. **How many ways you can create an object?**

- Object literal: `{}` 
- `Object.create()`
- Constructor function
- `class`

### 35. **What does we have in .tsconfig.json? can you explain them?**

`tsconfig.json` holds TypeScript compiler options like:
- **compilerOptions**: Specifies the compiler settings.
- **include**: Specifies which files are included.

### 36. **Problem Solving**

```js
function lcp(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return '';
  
  let prefix = arr[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    while (arr[i].indexOf(prefix) !== 0) {
      prefix = prefix.substring(0, prefix.length - 1);
    }
  }
  return prefix;
}

console.log(lcp(['saiteja', 'saviour', 'saas'])); // 'sa'
console.log(lcp(['racedog', 'car', 'racecar'])); // ''
```
