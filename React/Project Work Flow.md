To improve my team's workflow and collaboration in a React project, I used several simple strategies:

**Ensured Consistent Code Quality with ESLint and Prettier ✨**
Set up ESLint to catch errors and enforce coding rules, and combined it with Prettier to automatically format code in a consistent style.

**Automated Checks with Husky 🧑‍💻**
Configured Husky to run checks before every commit, like linting and testing, to prevent issues from being introduced.

**Improved Code Safety with TypeScript 🔍**
Added TypeScript for static type checking, reducing errors and helping developers write better code with enhanced IDE features.

**Created Better Documentation with Storybook 📚**
Used Storybook to visually document UI components, allowing developers to see and test them in isolation.

**Simplified Development with CI/CD ⚙️**
Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment, helping catch issues early and ensure smooth releases.

**Boosted Team Collaboration with Code Reviews and Pair Programming 👥**
Established regular code reviews and encouraged pair programming for real-time collaboration and learning.

**Managed Feature Releases with Feature Flags 🚦**
Introduced feature flags to control which features are active, allowing for safer deployments and gradual rollouts.
