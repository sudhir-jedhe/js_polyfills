***  How do you prioritize technical debt vs. new features?.md ***

Prioritizing technical debt against new feature development requires translating engineering friction into business risk. The most effective approach treats technical debt not as an abstract backlog to clear, but as an operational cost that directly impacts delivery speed, system reliability, and revenue.

### 1. Categorize the Debt by Impact

Not all technical debt carries the same weight. Classify debt into four distinct quadrants to determine its urgency:

| Debt Category                            | Description                                                                                      | Priority Level                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical Risk (Security / Stability)** | Vulnerabilities, memory leaks, unpatched dependencies, or fragile paths that cause downtime.     | **Immediate:** Schedule in the current or next sprint.          |
| **Velocity Blockers**                    | Messy code or poor abstractions in high-churn areas that make adding new features 3× slower.     | **High:** Tackle alongside related feature work.                |
| **Friction / Low-Churn**                 | Spaghetti code in a legacy module that is rarely touched and runs stably in production.          | **Low:** Defer until that module requires significant changes.  |
| **Aesthetic / Pedantic**                 | Inconsistent naming conventions or stylistic preferences that do not impact build times or bugs. | **Ignore / Low:** Fix during routine housekeeping if zero risk. |

### 2. Allocation Frameworks

Rather than pitting tech debt directly against features in every sprint planning debate, use structural capacity rules:

* **The 70 / 20 / 10 Capacity Model:**
* **70%:** New product features and user-requested enhancements.
* **20%:** Technical debt, performance optimizations, and infrastructure hardening.
* **10%:** Developer tooling, exploratory prototyping, and library upgrades.

* **The "Boy Scout Rule" (Incremental Refactoring):**
* Leave code cleaner than you found it. If a new feature requires touching a brittle module, include the refactoring time within the feature estimate rather than logging a separate ticket.

* **Dedicated Hardening / Investment Sprints:**
* Dedicate one sprint per quarter (or between major releases) entirely to technical health, dependency upgrades, and architectural cleanup.

### 3. Translate Technical Debt into Business Metrics

Product managers and stakeholders evaluate trade-offs based on user outcomes and cost. Frame technical debt in business terms:

* **Developer Velocity:** *"Refactoring our payment service will reduce delivery time for the next three roadmap features from 6 weeks to 2.5 weeks."*
* **Risk & Financial Exposure:** *"Staying on this unsupported framework exposes us to known CVE security vulnerabilities and risks compliance failures."*
* **Cost of Inaction (Interest):** *"This inefficient database query will spike server infrastructure costs by 40% when our active user base doubles next quarter."*
* **Customer Retention:** *"Resolving this state-sync issue will reduce error rates for checkout transactions by 15%."*

### 4. Decision Matrix: Feature vs. Debt

When a high-value feature and significant technical debt compete for the same engineering capacity:

```
                            High Business Impact
                                     │
           ┌─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┐
           │   Pay Debt Immediately │   Build Feature First   │
           │   (Prevent Outages /    │   (High Market Value /  │
           │    Blocker to Feature)  │    Low System Risk)     │
           ├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
Low Risk ──┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼── High Risk
           │   Defer / Ignore        │   Refactor Incrementally│
           │   (Low ROI, stable      │   (Boy Scout Rule during│
           │    isolated code)       │    future feature work) │
           └─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┘
                                     │
                            Low Business Impact

```

1. **If the debt directly blocks or threatens the new feature:** Fix the debt first (or as phase 1 of the feature).
2. **If the feature addresses a time-critical market window and debt risk is low:** Ship the feature, intentionally document the borrowed debt, and schedule a repayment window.
3. **If technical debt repeatedly causes production incidents (SLA breaches):** Technical debt automatically supersedes new features until reliability stabilizes.

### Summary Rule of Thumb

Never manage technical debt as a separate, invisible backlog that engineers beg to fix. Either **couple it directly to incoming feature work**, allocate a **guaranteed baseline capacity (15–20%)**, or justify it with **quantifiable business risk** (downtime cost, delivery slowdown, or infrastructure spend).
