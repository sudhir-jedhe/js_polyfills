Great question! Let’s untangle these two concepts. Both of them relate to optimizing your JavaScript bundle, but they serve different purposes.

**Tree Shaking**:
Tree shaking is all about eliminating dead code. When you import a library, you might not use every single function or class in it. Tree shaking helps identify and remove the parts of your code that aren’t being used. This is especially useful in large projects where many modules might not be fully utilized.

- **Purpose**: Reduce the amount of code in your final bundle by removing unused exports.
- **Usage**: Primarily in ES6 modules, as it relies on the static structure of imports and exports to identify dead code.

**Code Splitting**:
Code splitting, on the other hand, is about breaking up your code into smaller, more manageable chunks. Instead of loading your entire JavaScript bundle upfront, you can split it into pieces and load them as needed. This makes your application faster to load and more responsive to user interactions.

- **Purpose**: Improve performance by splitting your code into multiple bundles that can be loaded on-demand.
- **Usage**: Often utilized with tools like Webpack and libraries like React for dynamic imports or lazy loading.

In essence, **tree shaking** helps you get rid of unnecessary code, while **code splitting** helps you manage and load your code more efficiently. Think of tree shaking as trimming the excess branches off a tree and code splitting as organizing a bookshelf into categories for easier access.
