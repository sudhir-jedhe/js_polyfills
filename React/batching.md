In React, updating multiple state values inside a single `onClick` handler can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, particularly with **state batching**. State batching is an optimization where React groups multiple state updates together and performs them in a single render for better performance.

However, this can sometimes be "unstable" when updates are applied in ways that don't immediately reflect the expected state. Here's a deeper look into how **state batching** works, and how you can avoid issues when updating multiple states on a single `onClick`.

### React State Batching

React automatically batches state updates inside event handlers (like `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.). This means that if you call `setState` multiple times in a single function, React will only re-render the component once, even though multiple updates may have been made. The updates may appear to happen in a "batch," but React internally optimizes it by combining the state updates and performing them in one go.

### Problem with "Unstable Batching"
Sometimes, you might want to access the previous state value when updating multiple states. React's batched updates may not always give you the expected result if you're depending on the immediate effect of one `setState` to compute the next.

### Example of Problematic Code

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // This may not reflect the latest count immediately
    setMessage('Updated count');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Message: {message}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Update</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Explanation:
In the code above:
- When you click the button, both `setCount` and `setMessage` are called one after the other.
- Due to React's state batching, **`count` will not immediately reflect the updated value** when `setMessage` is called, because both state updates will be batched together. 

### Solving the Problem
To handle such cases and ensure that state updates occur correctly, use a **functional update** pattern for state updates that depend on the previous state.

#### Functional Update with `setState`

When the state update depends on the previous state (like in the case of `count + 1`), you should use a **function form** of `setState` that gives you access to the current state.

### Corrected Example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Use the functional form of setState to ensure correct update based on previous state
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);  // Correctly increments based on previous state
    setMessage('Updated count');             // Set message after count update
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <p>Message: {message}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Update</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Explanation of Fix:
- **`setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1)`**: By passing a function to `setCount`, React will ensure that `prevCount` is always the most up-to-date value when calculating the new state. This avoids the issue of `count` being stale.
- **`setMessage('Updated count')`**: This still works as expected because it doesn't rely on the previous state.

### Key Takeaways:
- **State Batching**: React batches state updates in event handlers to optimize performance.
- **Accessing Previous State**: When your state updates depend on the previous state (e.g., incrementing a counter), always use the functional form of `setState` to access the most recent state.
- **No Need for `unstable_batchedUpdates`**: Normally, you donâ€™t need to use `unstable_batchedUpdates` unless you're working with non-React events or complex cases outside React's normal flow.

By following this pattern, you'll ensure that your state updates behave as expected even when batching occurs.
