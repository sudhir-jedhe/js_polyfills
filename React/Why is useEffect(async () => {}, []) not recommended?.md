***  Why is useEffect(async () => {}, []) not recommended?.md ***

 is not recommended because React effects cannot return a Promise. [1, 2]  
An  function automatically returns a Promise. However, React expects a  hook to return either nothing () or a cleanup function. [3, 4, 5, 6]  
Why This Causes Problems

• Breaks Cleanup Functions: React runs the function you return from  to clean up side effects (like clearing timers or unsubscribing from events). If you pass an  function, React receives a Promise instead of a cleanup function, which triggers a runtime error or memory leaks.
• Race Conditions: It makes it easier to accidentally introduce race conditions if components unmount before the asynchronous operation finishes. [12]  

The Recommended Solutions
To safely use  inside , you must define the asynchronous function inside the effect and then call it immediately. [13, 14]  
Option 1: Declaring and Calling an Internal FunctionOption 2: Using an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) Handling Cleanups Safely
If your asynchronous operation needs a cleanup mechanism (such as ignoring the result if the component unmounts), use a boolean flag: [15, 16, 17]  
To help optimize your data fetching setup, let me know:

• Are you fetching data from a REST API or a GraphQL endpoint?
• Do you need to handle loading and error states?
• Are you open to using data-fetching libraries like TanStack Query (React Query) or SWR? [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]
