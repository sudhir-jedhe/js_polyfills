*** copy Why do frontend engineers who can build any component still struggle in system design interviews?.md ***

plit these into:

Functional: what it should do
Non-functional: how it should behave (UX, constraints, scale)

𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 (High-Level Design)

- Frontend ↔ backend communication
- Real-time choice: WebSockets vs SSE vs polling
- State management: Redux vs Context vs Context + Reducer
- Page + component hierarchy

In this section, you need to show that you can design and have valid reasons about why one should be chosen over other.

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 (How do we structure data?)

- What shape do your objects have?
- How do they live in state?
- How do they flow across components and APIs?

𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀: Here you can specify following things:

- Endpoints, payloads, expected responses
- Error shapes
- Pagination, filtering, search patterns

Here you should focus on contracts and expectations and not implementation.

𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 (How to make it fast & usable?)

- Caching strategies
- Lazy loading, request batching
- Accessibility
- Error + loading states

These small details are what signal maturity in frontend design.

Without a framework, you're improvising under pressure and forgetting half the picture.
With R.A.D.I.O, you have a checklist that scales to any system design questio
