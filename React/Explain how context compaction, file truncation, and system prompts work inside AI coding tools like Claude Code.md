*** copy Explain how context compaction, file truncation, and system prompts work inside AI coding tools like Claude Code.md ***

AI coding CLI agents—such as Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, and Windsurf—operate inside a fundamental constraint: **the finite, non-extendable context window of Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Every tool call, terminal output, file read, system prompt, and user message consumes tokens. If the context window fills up, model latency spikes, reasoning quality degrades ("context rot"), and eventually the API call fails.

To overcome this, AI coding tools use a sophisticated context engine powered by **Context Compaction**, **File Truncation**, and **Dynamic System Prompts**.

## 1. System Prompts: The Agent's Operating System

The system prompt is the static or semi-dynamic foundation injected at the very top of every API request. It acts as the agent's "operating system," defining its persona, available tools, safety boundaries, and reasoning patterns.

### Key Components of an Agent System Prompt

1. **Tool Definitions (JSON Schema):** Teaches the model how to invoke filesystem and terminal tools (`ViewFile`, `EditFile`, `RunCommand`, `GrepSearch`).
2. **Behavioral Invariants:** Enforces strict execution rules:

* *"Always test your changes using the test runner before declaring a task complete."*
* *"Do not output full re-written files when applying edits; use unified diff patches."*
* *"Check git status before and after file operations."*

1. **Environment & Context Awareness:** Dynamically injects metadata about the local machine during initialization:

* Current OS (macOS/Linux/Windows), shell environment (`bash`/`zsh`).
* Project workspace directory path and repository root.
* Primary language runtimes detected (`Node.js v20`, `Python 3.11`, `Rust 1.78`).

## 2. File Truncation: Preventing Token Inflation

A naive agent that loads an entire 3,000-line source file into context can burn 20,000+ tokens in a single tool call. To prevent this, tools employ **File Truncation** strategies.

```text
 ❌ Naive Full File Injection:
 [ Entire 3,000 Line File ] ──► Consumes 25,000 Tokens ──► Exhausts Context Frame

 ✅ Intelligent Truncation & Slicing:
 [ Skeleton / AST Structure ] + [ Line-Bounded Window (Lines 120-180) ] ──► Consumes 800 Tokens

```

### Truncation Strategies Used by Agents

* **Line-Bounded Windowing:** Tools like `ViewFile` accept parameters like `start_line` and `end_line`. Instead of reading the whole file, the agent reads only lines 100 to 200 around the target function.
* **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Skeletonization:** For large files, tools strip implementation bodies and expose only function signatures, interfaces, exports, and docstrings. The LLM sees *what* functions exist without wasting tokens on *how* they are implemented until it needs to edit a specific function.
* **Terminal Output Truncation:** When a shell command (like `npm test` or `pytest`) outputs 5,000 lines of build logs, the agent clips the output, preserving only the **first 20 lines** (command initialization) and **last 100 lines** (the stack trace and error summary).

## 3. Context Compaction: Summarizing History

As an agent performs multi-step tasks (reading 15 files, running 8 bash commands, searching codebases), the conversation history grows rapidly. When token usage crosses a threshold (typically **70–80% of capacity**), the agent triggers **Context Compaction**.

```text
 PRE-COMPACTION CONTEXT (Full Execution History - High Token Count)
 [ System Prompt ] ──► [ User Task ] ──► [ Tool Call 1 ] ──► [ File Read 1 ] ──► ... ──► [ Tool Call 20 ]

                                      │
                                      ▼ (Trigger: Context > 80% Capacity)
                          LLM Summarization Pass

 POST-COMPACTION CONTEXT (Compacted Context - Low Token Count)
 [ System Prompt ] ──► [ Compacted History Summary ] ──► [ Active Memory File Cache ] ──► [ Latest Messages ]

```

### How Context Compaction Works Step-by-Step

1. **Threshold Detection:** The agent calculates cumulative token usage using tokenizer libraries (`tiktoken` or model-specific APIs).
2. **History Segmentation:** The agent preserves the **System Prompt**, the **Original User Goal**, and the **Last N Messages** (recent active context).
3. **Summarization Pass:** The middle portion of the conversation history (old tool outputs, raw file contents, intermediate reasoning) is sent to a background LLM call with a prompt like:

> *"Summarize the progress made so far. List: (1) Files modified, (2) Key architectural decisions made, (3) Current errors remaining, and (4) Next immediate steps."*

1. **Context Substitution:** The verbose middle history is discarded and replaced with the generated **Summary Block**.
2. **Memory Persistence (`CONVERSATION_SUMMARY.md`):** Advanced agents write this summary to disk or a special internal scratchpad so that even across restarts, high-level context remains intact.

## 4. Architectural Comparison: Raw History vs. Compaction Pipeline

| Component             | Unmanaged Context                                          | Managed Agent Context Pipeline                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **File Reading**      | Loads full file text verbatim                              | Uses line slicing, AST skeletons, and diff patches           |
| **Shell Commands**    | Streams entire stdout/stderr into context                  | Truncates middle output, preserving head + tail stack traces |
| **History Growth**    | Linear growth until context overflow error                 | Dynamic compaction / sliding window summarization            |
| **Token Efficiency**  | Poor (~10-15 steps before context limit)                   | Exceptional (Handles hundreds of continuous reasoning steps) |
| **Model Performance** | Degrades due to attention confusion ("lost in the middle") | Maintains sharp focus by keeping active context small        |

## Summary Checklist for Developers

* **Why context gets slow:** Large shell outputs and un-truncated file reads flood the context window, forcing the agent to spend more time processing tokens.
* **How compaction helps you:** Compaction allows an agent session to run for hours without crashing, maintaining a "working memory" summary while dropping obsolete raw file dumps.
* **Best developer practice:** Periodically clear or restart agent context (e.g., `/compact` or `/clear` commands) when switching to a completely new feature to give the agent a fresh, un-contaminated context window.
