To prevent your React application (or any website) from being embedded in an iframe, you can take several measures to block or restrict the ability of other websites from framing your content. Here's how you can achieve this:

### 1. **Using the X-Frame-Options HTTP Header**

The `X-Frame-Options` header is an HTTP response header that can be used to control whether your content can be embedded within an iframe. You can set this header on the server side of your application.

#### Options for `X-Frame-Options`:
- **DENY**: Prevents any domain from embedding your content in an iframe.
- **SAMEORIGIN**: Allows only the same origin (i.e., your own domain) to embed the content.
- **ALLOW-FROM uri**: Allows a specific URL to embed your content.

#### Example: In an Express.js Server (Node.js)
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Prevent the app from being embedded in an iframe from any domain
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY'); // or 'SAMEORIGIN' or 'ALLOW-FROM https://example.com'
  next();
});

// Your other routes and configurations
```

#### Example: In an Nginx server
In the Nginx configuration, you can set the `X-Frame-Options` header like this:
```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";   # or "SAMEORIGIN"
```

### 2. **Using Content Security Policy (CSP)**

The Content Security Policy (CSP) header provides more granular control over how your content is loaded and embedded. The `frame-ancestors` directive in CSP allows you to define which domains are allowed to embed your content in iframes.

#### Example: Using CSP to prevent embedding
```plaintext
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';
```

This will block all external websites from embedding your website in an iframe. If you want to allow your own website to embed the content, use:
```plaintext
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';
```

You can also allow specific trusted domains:
```plaintext
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' https://trusted-domain.com;
```

#### Example: In an Express.js Server (Node.js)
```javascript
const helmet = require('helmet');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Enable CSP with frame-ancestors to block iframe embedding
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    frameAncestors: ["'none'"], // Prevent embedding
  }
}));

// Your other routes and configurations
```

#### Example: In Nginx
```nginx
add_header Content-Security-Policy "frame-ancestors 'none';";
```

### 3. **Using JavaScript to Detect if Your Site is Embedded in an iframe**

You can add a small JavaScript snippet to your React app to detect if it's being loaded inside an iframe and, if so, redirect the user or show a message.

#### JavaScript Code to Prevent Iframe Embedding:

```javascript
if (window.self !== window.top) {
  // This code will execute if the site is in an iframe
  // Option 1: Redirect to the top-level window (break out of iframe)
  window.top.location = window.location.href;

  // Option 2: Optionally, show an alert
  // alert("This website cannot be embedded in an iframe.");
}
```

You can place this code in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method or `useEffect` hook in your React application to ensure that it runs as soon as the component is mounted.

#### Example in React (using `useEffect`):
```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (window.self !== window.top) {
      window.top.location = window.location.href;
    }
  }, []);

  return <div>Your React App content</div>;
};

export default App;
```

### 4. **Combining Multiple Strategies**

For maximum protection, you should combine server-side headers like `X-Frame-Options` and CSP with client-side JavaScript. This provides a layered defense that ensures your website cannot be embedded in an iframe, regardless of the attack vector.

- **Server-side headers** provide strong protection against embedding by any external site.
- **Client-side JavaScript** provides an extra layer of defense in case the headers are bypassed (though unlikely if set correctly).

### 5. **Considerations:**
- **Compatibility**: The `X-Frame-Options` header is widely supported, but it has been replaced by `frame-ancestors` in CSP, which provides more fine-grained control.
- **User Experience**: If you use the client-side JavaScript method to redirect users or display a message, make sure it doesn’t interfere with the user experience on valid use cases (e.g., if your app is intentionally embedded in an iframe in specific cases).
  
By implementing these techniques, you can effectively prevent your React website from being embedded in an iframe.
