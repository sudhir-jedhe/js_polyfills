*** copy class component vs function component in performance  build.md ***

When comparing class components and function components, performance isn't just about runtime execution speed—it also directly impacts build size, bundle optimization, and tree-shaking efficiency.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of how class components and function components perform across both runtime and build metrics in modern React (React 18/19).

---

## 1. Build Size and Bundle Metrics

In terms of build performance and bundle size, **function components win decisively**.

### JavaScript Output & Minification

When JavaScript bundlers (Webpack, Vite, Rollup) and minifiers (Terser, esbuild) process your code, function components produce significantly smaller output than class components.

* **Class Overhead:** ES6 classes require prototype setups, constructor calls, and `this` binding logic. When compiled down to ES5 (for broader browser compatibility), class syntax expands into verbose helper functions (`_classCallCheck`, `_createClass`, `_inherits`).
* **Function Simplicity:** Function components are plain JavaScript functions that take `props` and return JSX. They compile into minimal code with almost no extra syntax.

```javascript
// Function Component Output (Compact)
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello ', name);
}

// Class Component Output (Verbose compiled JavaScript)
var Greeting = (function (_super) {
  _inherits(Greeting, _super);
  function Greeting() {
    _classCallCheck(this, Greeting);
    return _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (Greeting.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(Greeting)).apply(this, arguments));
  }
  _createClass(Greeting, [{
    key: 'render',
    value: function render() {
      return React.createElement('div', null, 'Hello ', this.props.name);
    }
  }]);
  return Greeting;
})(React.Component);

```

### Tree-Shaking and Dead-Code Elimination

* **Class Components:** Classes in JavaScript are treated as single stateful objects with attached prototypes. Bundlers struggle to determine if individual class methods are unused, making **tree-shaking class methods almost impossible**.
* **Function Components & Hooks:** Custom hooks and helper functions imported into function components are standalone, pure modules. Bundlers can easily tree-shake unused custom hooks or utility functions during the build phase.

## 2. Runtime Performance

In simple benchmark rendering, **raw execution speed between class and function components is nearly identical**. The React Virtual DOM reconciler treats both component types similarly when diffing elements.

However, in real-world application performance, function components offer superior optimization capabilities.

### Memory Footprint

* **Class Components:** Every instance of a class component instantiates a full class object in JavaScript memory with properties like `this.state`, `this.props`, lifecycle method references, and context bindings.
* **Function Components:** Function components use closure scopes and light function execution frames. When combined with Hooks (like `useState`), primitive values or references are stored in React's internal fiber node array without the overhead of an ES6 class instance.

### Fine-Grained Re-rendering Controls

| Optimization Mechanism           | Class Components                                                      | Function Components                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shallow Re-render Control**    | `React.PureComponent` or `shouldComponentUpdate`                      | `React.memo`                                                          |
| **Referential Stability**        | Manual `this.method = this.method.bind(this)` in constructor          | `useCallback`                                                         |
| **Calculated Value Caching**     | Stored on `this` instance or recalculated in `render()`               | `useMemo`                                                             |
| **Concurrent Rendering Support** | Poor (lifecycles like `componentWillMount` cause unsafe side effects) | Excellent (native support for `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue`) |

### Garbage Collection & Micro-Optimizations

In older V8 JavaScript engines, function components suffered slightly because inline callbacks (`onClick={() => ...}`) created new function instances on every render.

In modern engines, function instantiation cost is negligible. Furthermore, function components avoid issues where class method closures accidentally hold onto large object references in `this`, preventing effective JavaScript Garbage Collection (GC).

## Summary Comparison

| Metric                   | Function Components                                                  | Class Components                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bundle Size**          | **Significantly Smaller** (Less syntax overhead, compresses better)  | **Larger** (Class helpers, prototype setup)           |
| **Tree-Shaking**         | **High** (Modular hooks & utilities easily pruned)                   | **Low** (Class prototypes cannot be tree-shaken)      |
| **Memory Consumption**   | **Lower** (No class instances allocated)                             | **Higher** (Allocates ES6 class object instances)     |
| **React 18/19 Features** | **Full Support** (Concurrent Rendering, Server Components, Suspense) | **Legacy / Restricted** (Cannot use modern Hooks API) |
| **Compilation Speed**    | **Faster** (Simpler AST transforms)                                  | **Slower** (Complex class transformation AST)         |

## Conclusion

From a modern build and performance perspective, **Function Components with Hooks are the clear standard**. They yield smaller bundle sizes, lower memory overhead, better tree-shaking capabilities, and native access to React's concurrent performance features (`useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, and React Server Components).
