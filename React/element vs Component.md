In React, the terms "element" and "component" refer to different concepts:

### 1. **React Element**
A React element is a plain object that represents a DOM node (or a virtual DOM node). It is the building block of React applications and describes what you want to see on the screen. React elements are created using JSX or React.createElement().

- **Example of a React Element**:
  ```jsx
  const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
  ```
  In this example, the JSX `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>` creates a React element that represents an `<h1>` tag with the text "Hello, world!" in it.

- **Key Points**:
  - React elements are immutable (cannot be modified after creation).
  - They describe the structure of your UI at a specific point in time.
  - React elements are rendered into the DOM by React.

### 2. **React Component**
A React component is a function or class that can accept input (props) and returns a React element (or another component). Components are the core building blocks for constructing React applications, as they allow you to break down the UI into reusable and modular pieces.

- **Example of a React Functional Component**:
  ```jsx
  function Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
  }
  ```
  Here, `Greeting` is a component that receives a `name` prop and renders a greeting.

- **Example of a React Class Component**:
  ```jsx
  class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
    }
  }
  ```
  This is the class-based equivalent of the above functional component.

- **Key Points**:
  - Components can manage their own state and lifecycle.
  - Components can be composed together to create complex UIs.
  - Components can return one or more React elements.

### Key Differences

| Aspect            | React Element                             | React Component                        |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | A description of a UI element.            | A function or class that returns UI elements. |
| **Mutability**     | Immutable once created.                   | Can manage internal state and lifecycle. |
| **Usage**          | Represents the output of a component.     | Contains logic and rendering instructions for elements. |
| **Example**        | `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`                  | `function App() { return <h1>Hello</h1>; }` |
| **Composition**    | Can be used to build UI but not reusable. | Can be reused, composed, and nested to build complex UIs. |

In summary, a **React element** is a description of a piece of UI, while a **React component** is a function or class that returns React elements (and can handle additional logic and state). Components build the UI, and elements represent the structure of that UI.
