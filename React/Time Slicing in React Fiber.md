Here is a clean, structured technical reference guide explaining **Time Slicing**, how `shouldYield()` operates within the Fiber `workLoop`, and how React maintains main-thread responsiveness during heavy renders.

# Time Slicing in React Fiber: Cooperative Multitasking on the Main Thread

Because JavaScript runs on a single thread, heavy UI reconciliation can block the browser's main thread, causing dropped animation frames and un-responsive user inputs.

**Time Slicing** is the mechanism built into React Fiber and the `scheduler` package that splits heavy render work into small, non-blocking time slices (typically ~5ms frames), turning React into a **cooperative multi-tasker**.

## 1. Stack Reconciler vs. Fiber + Time Slicing

```text
 1. STACK RECONCILER (Pre-React 16) — Synchronous / Greedy
 [ ════════════════ 80ms Uninterruptible Render Pass ════════════════ ] ──► Browser Frozen!
 
 2. FIBER + TIME SLICING (React 16+) — Asynchronous / Cooperative
 [ 5ms Render ] ──► [ Paint/Input ] ──► [ 5ms Render ] ──► [ Paint/Input ] ──► Render Complete!

```

| Metric                   | Stack Reconciler                     | Fiber + Time Slicing                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Model**      | Recursive call stack (Blocking)      | Iterative `workLoop` on heap (Interruptible)      |
| **Main Thread Strategy** | Monopolizes thread until complete    | Yields to browser every ~5ms                      |
| **Frame Rate Impact**    | Long tasks cause severe frame drops  | Maintains steady 60fps / 120fps UI responsiveness |
| **User Input Priority**  | Keypresses queued behind render pass | Keypresses interrupt background work              |

## 2. How `shouldYield()` Works Inside the `workLoop`

During the Render Phase, React iterates through the Fiber tree using the `workLoop`. After processing each individual Fiber node, React checks whether it has exceeded its time budget using **`shouldYield()`**.

```text
                       ┌───────────────────────────┐
                       │      WORKLOOP CORE        │
                       └─────────────┬─────────────┘
                                     │
                             Pick Next Fiber Node
                                     │
                                     ▼
                            performUnitOfWork()
                                     │
                                     ▼
                         Is shouldYield() true?
                                   /   \
                             (YES)/     \(NO)
                                 /       \
                                ▼         ▼
                        Yield to Browser   Continue to Next Fiber
                      (MessageChannel)

```

### The Internal Mechanism of `shouldYield()`

1. **Timestamp Check:** When a time slice begins, Scheduler records `currentTime` and sets a deadline (`deadline = currentTime + 5ms`).
2. **Per-Fiber Evaluation:** Inside the `workLoop`, React calls `shouldYield()` after every `performUnitOfWork(fiber)`:

```javascript
function shouldYieldToHost() {
  const timeElapsed = getCurrentTime() - startTime;
  if (timeElapsed < 5) {
    return false; // Budget remaining: continue processing
  }
  return true; // Budget exhausted: yield back to browser!
}

```

1. **Yielding Control:** If `shouldYield()` returns `true`, React saves its current position in the `workInProgress` Fiber tree and schedules a continuation task using `MessageChannel.port.postMessage()`. This yields control back to the browser event loop to paint pixels or process click/typing events.
2. **Resuming:** On the next frame, Scheduler invokes the saved continuation callback, picking up rendering at the exact Fiber node where it yielded.

## 3. What Time Slicing Enables in Modern React

### A. Non-Blocking Transitions (`startTransition` / `useDeferredValue`)

When updates are wrapped in `startTransition`, React assigns them to **`TransitionLanes`** (low priority).

* Time Slicing allows React to process these low-priority updates in 5ms chunks.
* If a high-priority event occurs (e.g., user typing into an input field mapped to `SyncLane`), React **interrupts and discards** the in-progress transition work, processes the input immediately, and then resumes the transition rendering.

### B. Suspense and Concurrent Rendering

Time Slicing allows React to pause rendering a component branch if it encounters missing code or data (Suspense), render other parts of the tree, and resume once the promise resolves—all without blocking the UI.
