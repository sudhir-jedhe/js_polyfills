*** copy CD basics, logging, and deployment process.md ***

Here is a complete overview of a production-proven **Git workflow, CI/CD pipeline, logging strategy, and deployment process** for modern web applications.

# 1. Git Workflow (Trunk-Based / Feature Branch Hybrid)

A structured Git strategy keeps codebases stable, avoids merge conflicts, and enables rapid releases.

```text
 feature/add-login ──┐
                     ├──► PR (Review + CI Checks) ──► main (Production Ready)
 fix/token-leak    ──┘

```

* **Branching Strategy:**
* **`main` (or `master`):** Represents production-ready code. Protected branch where direct pushes are disabled.
* **Feature/Bugfix Branches (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`):** Short-lived branches created off `main` for individual user stories or bug fixes.

* **Pull Requests (PRs) & Code Reviews:**
* Developers open a PR into `main` once features are tested locally.
* PRs require at least **1 peer code review approval** and must pass all automated CI status checks (linting, tests, build).
* PRs are merged using **Squash and Merge** to keep the `main` commit log clean and linear.

# 2. CI/CD Pipeline Basics

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) automate code testing, building, and deployment, eliminating manual errors.

### A. Continuous Integration (CI)

Triggered automatically when a Pull Request is opened or updated:

1. **Checkout & Caching:** Pulls the code and restores cached dependencies (`node_modules`) to speed up execution.
2. **Static Code Analysis & Linting:** Runs ESLint/Prettier to enforce code style and catch code smells.
3. **Automated Testing:** Runs unit tests (`Jest`, `React Testing Library`) and integration tests to ensure no breaking changes.
4. **Build Verification:** Executes `npm run build` to verify that production bundles compile without TypeScript or bundle errors.

### B. Continuous Deployment (CD)

Triggered automatically when code is merged into `main`:

1. **Docker Image Build:** Packages the application into an immutable Docker container image tagged with the Git commit hash (`v1.2.0-a1b2c3d`).
2. **Container Registry Push:** Pushes the built image to a secure registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Docker Hub).
3. **Environment Promotion:** Deploys the image to **Staging/QA** first for automated smoke tests, then promotes the *exact same container image* to **Production**.

# 3. Production Logging & Monitoring Strategy

Effective logging is crucial for root-cause analysis, security auditing, and tracking system health without exposing sensitive data.

* **Structured JSON Logging:** Logs are emitted as structured JSON strings (using tools like `Winston` or `Pino` in Node.js) rather than unstructured text. This enables log aggregators to easily index fields:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-08-05T03:19:26Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Order processed successfully",
  "correlationId": "req-998811",
  "userId": "usr_123",
  "durationMs": 42
}

```

* **Log Aggregation & Centralization:** Application logs (`stdout`/`stderr`) are shipped to centralized platforms (e.g., Datadog, ELK Stack, or AWS CloudWatch) via log collectors (FluentBit).
* **Correlation IDs:** Every incoming HTTP request is assigned a unique `X-Correlation-ID` at the API Gateway level. This ID is passed through all downstream microservice calls and database queries to trace complete request lifetimes.
* **Security & Sensitive Data Masking:** Middleware automatically redacts sensitive keys (passwords, JWT tokens, credit card numbers, PII) before writing logs.
* **Error Tracking:** Tools like **Sentry** capture unhandled exceptions in real time, grouping duplicate errors and alerting team channels.

# 4. Production Deployment Process

To achieve **zero-downtime deployments**, production environments use progressive deployment strategies.

### Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategies

#### A. Rolling Deployments (Default for Kubernetes)

* New container pods replace old pods incrementally (e.g., replacing 25% of pods at a time).
* **Readiness Probes (`/healthz`):** Ensures a new pod is fully booted and connected to the database *before* the load balancer routes live traffic to it.

#### B. Blue/Green Deployments

* **Blue:** Current live production environment.
* **Green:** Identical new environment running the newly deployed code.
* Once the Green environment passes automated smoke tests, the API Gateway/Load Balancer switches traffic to Green instantly ($0$ downtime). If an issue occurs, traffic routes back to Blue instantly.

#### C. Rollback Safeguards

* **Automated Rollbacks:** If health checks fail or error rates spike (monitored via APM) immediately after deployment, the system automatically rolls back traffic to the previous stable image tag.
* **Database Migrations:** Schema changes follow a **backward-compatible, multi-step process** (e.g., expanding columns first, updating code, and contracting deprecated columns later) so older app instances don't break during deployments.
