### **React Memoization**

In React, **memoization** is a performance optimization technique used to avoid unnecessary re-renders of components by caching the results of expensive function calls or operations and reusing them when the inputs have not changed. This helps improve the performance of your application by preventing unnecessary computations or re-renderings, especially for components that rely on props or state that do not change frequently.

React provides several tools and techniques for memoization:

1. **`React.memo()`**: A higher-order component (HOC) that memoizes function components.
2. **`useMemo()`**: A React hook to memoize values or computations inside a function component.
3. **`useCallback()`**: A React hook to memoize callback functions in a function component.

Let’s dive deeper into each of these tools.

### **1. `React.memo()`**

`React.memo()` is a higher-order component (HOC) that memoizes a **function component**. It prevents a component from re-rendering unless its props change.

#### **How it Works:**

When `React.memo()` is applied to a component, React will only re-render that component if its props have changed between renders. If the props are the same as the previous render, React will skip the re-render and reuse the last rendered output.

#### **Example:**

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Simple component
const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ count }) => {
  console.log('Child component re-rendered');
  return <div>{count}</div>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('John');

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent count={count} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setName(name === 'John' ? 'Jane' : 'John')}>Change Name</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

#### **Explanation:**
- The `ChildComponent` is wrapped with `React.memo()`. This means it will only re-render if the `count` prop changes.
- Clicking the "Increment" button updates the `count`, which will trigger a re-render of `ChildComponent`.
- Clicking the "Change Name" button updates the `name` state, but since it doesn’t affect the `count` prop, `ChildComponent` will **not** re-render, thanks to `React.memo()`.

#### **When to Use:**
- `React.memo()` is useful when a function component receives complex objects or arrays as props and you want to avoid re-rendering unless those objects/arrays change.

#### **Custom Comparison Function:**
You can also pass a custom comparison function as a second argument to `React.memo()` to determine whether the component should re-render based on prop changes.

```js
const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ count, name }) => {
  console.log('Child component re-rendered');
  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  return prevProps.count === nextProps.count; // Only re-render if `count` changes
});
```

In this example, `ChildComponent` will only re-render when the `count` prop changes. If the `name` prop changes, the component will not re-render.

### **2. `useMemo()`**

`useMemo()` is a hook that memoizes a **computed value** and only recomputes it when the dependencies change. This is useful for expensive calculations or operations that you want to avoid performing on every render.

#### **How it Works:**

The hook returns a memoized value, which is recalculated only when one or more dependencies change.

#### **Example:**

```js
import React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ number }) => {
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  // Expensive computation
  const expensiveComputation = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Expensive computation re-calculated');
    return number * 2;
  }, [number]); // Recalculates only when `number` changes

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Expensive Computation: {expensiveComputation}</h2>
      <input type="text" value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExpensiveComponent;
```

#### **Explanation:**
- The `expensiveComputation` is memoized using `useMemo()`. It only recalculates when the `number` prop changes. If `number` stays the same, the previous result is reused, avoiding unnecessary recalculations.
- In this example, typing in the input does not trigger the expensive computation because the `input` state is not part of the `useMemo` dependencies. Therefore, only changes in `number` will trigger the recalculation.

#### **When to Use:**
- Use `useMemo()` to memoize expensive computations or derived values that do not change frequently, ensuring that you don’t redo the computation on every render.

### **3. `useCallback()`**

`useCallback()` is a hook that memoizes a **function** to prevent it from being recreated on every render unless its dependencies change. This is useful for passing functions as props to child components, especially when those child components are wrapped in `React.memo()`.

#### **How it Works:**

The hook returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies changes.

#### **Example:**

```js
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('Child component re-rendered');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Memoizing the callback function
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); // Only re-create the function if `count` changes

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />
      <div>Count: {count}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

#### **Explanation:**
- The `handleClick` function is memoized using `useCallback()`. It will only be recreated when the `count` state changes.
- The `ChildComponent` is wrapped in `React.memo()`. Since the `handleClick` function is memoized, it will not trigger unnecessary re-renders of `ChildComponent` when `count` changes but `handleClick` remains the same.

#### **When to Use:**
- Use `useCallback()` when you pass functions as props to child components, and those child components are memoized with `React.memo()`. It prevents unnecessary re-creation of the function on each render.

### **When to Use Memoization in React**

- **Expensive computations**: Use `useMemo()` to memoize expensive calculations that don’t need to be recomputed every render.
- **Component re-renders**: Use `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of function components that depend on props that don’t change frequently.
- **Callback functions**: Use `useCallback()` to memoize callback functions that are passed as props to child components, especially when those child components are wrapped in `React.memo()`.

### **When Not to Use Memoization**

- **Overuse of memoization**: Don't apply memoization everywhere, as it can add unnecessary complexity and overhead. Memoization is beneficial only when components are expensive to render or compute.
- **Simple components**: For simple components with fast rendering or when props change frequently, memoization may not offer much benefit and could actually slow down the app due to the overhead of checking dependencies.

---

### **Conclusion**

Memoization is a powerful technique for optimizing performance in React applications. By using `React.memo()`, `useMemo()`, and `useCallback()`, you can prevent unnecessary re-renders and recalculations, especially in components that rely on expensive operations or functions. Properly using memoization can significantly enhance the responsiveness and efficiency of your React application.
