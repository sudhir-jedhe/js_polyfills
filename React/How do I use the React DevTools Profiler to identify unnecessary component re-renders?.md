*** copy How do I use the React DevTools Profiler to identify unnecessary component re-renders?.md ***

The **React DevTools Profiler** is a browser extension tool that records component render times and reasons. It allows you to pinpoint exactly which components are re-rendering, how long those renders take, and **why** they re-rendered.

---

## Step 1: Enable "Record Why Each Component Rendered"

By default, the profiler tells you *that* a component rendered, but not *why*. Enabling render reasons is the most critical setup step.

1. Open **Chrome/Firefox DevTools** and select the **Profiler** (or **⚛️ Profiler**) tab.
2. Click the **Gear Icon ⚙️** (Settings) in the top-right corner of the React DevTools panel.
3. Select the **Profiler** tab inside the settings overlay.
4. Check the box: **"Record why each component rendered while profiling."**
5. Close the settings panel.

## Step 2: Record a Performance Profile

1. Click the blue **Record Circle ⚫** button in the Profiler tab.
2. Perform the specific user action in your app that feels sluggish or that you suspect triggers unnecessary re-renders (e.g., typing in an input field or opening a modal).
3. Click the red **Stop Circle 🔴** button to end recording.

## Step 3: Analyze Renders Using the Charts

Once stopped, the Profiler displays a ranked timeline of **commits** (each time React applied updates to the DOM).

### 1. Flamegraph Chart

The Flamegraph represents the component tree hierarchy for a selected commit:

* **Color Coding:**
* **Grey:** The component did **not** re-render during this commit.
* **Yellow/Orange/Red:** The component re-rendered and took significant time to render (Darker/Warmer = Slower).
* **Blue/Green:** The component re-rendered quickly.

* **Bar Width:** Represents how long the component took to render relative to its siblings.

### 2. Ranked Chart

Click the **Ranked** tab at the top of the profiler panel to view components sorted purely by **render time** (slowest at the top). This immediately highlights performance bottlenecks.

## Step 4: Identify Unnecessary Re-renders & Their Causes

Click on any highlighted component in the Flamegraph or Ranked chart. Look at the **right-hand panel** titled **"Why did this render?"**.

React DevTools will display one of the following exact reasons:

| Stated Render Reason            | What it Means                                                          | How to Fix It                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Props changed: [propName]"** | A parent passed a new prop reference.                                  | If `propName` is an inline object/array or callback, wrap it in `useMemo` or `useCallback` in the parent, and wrap the child in `React.memo`. |
| **"Parent component rendered"** | The parent re-rendered, forcing this child to re-render automatically. | If the child's props haven't changed, wrap the child component in `React.memo` to skip child renders.                                         |
| **"State changed"**             | Internal `useState` or `useReducer` was triggered.                     | Check if state is stored too high up in the tree, or if unnecessary state updates are firing.                                                 |
| **"Context changed"**           | A React Context value consumed by `useContext` updated.                | Split large context objects into smaller, focused contexts, or wrap context values in `useMemo`.                                              |

## Step 5: Turn On Visual Highlight Flash Indicators

To spot unnecessary renders in real-time **while interacting with your application without recording a profile**:

1. Click the **Gear Icon ⚙️** in React DevTools.
2. Under the **General** tab, check **"Highlight updates when components render."**
3. Interacting with your app will now draw colored rectangular borders around components on screen as they re-render.

* **Green/Yellow flash:** Low/Moderate render frequency.
* **Red flash:** Rapid, high-frequency re-renders (e.g., typing into an un-memoized text input causing an entire page list to re-render on every keystroke).

## Summary Checklist for Identifying Waste

1. Look for **grey parent components** whose **children are yellow/orange**.
2. Check if a component's render reason says **"Parent component rendered"** even though its props didn't change—this is a prime candidate for `React.memo`.
3. Check if props say **`Props changed: [onClick]`** across renders—this indicates an un-memoized function reference that needs `useCallback`.
