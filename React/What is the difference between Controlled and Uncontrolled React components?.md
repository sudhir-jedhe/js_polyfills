A controlled component drives a form input from React state — you pass value/checked plus an onChange handler, and React state is the single source of truth. An uncontrolled component lets the DOM keep the value; you read it via a ref (or on submit) and seed the initial value with defaultValue/defaultChecked. Controlled inputs are the right default when you need validation, conditional UI, or to derive other state from the value. Uncontrolled inputs are simpler for write-once forms and for <input type="file">, which is always uncontrolled. React 19 also added first-class form support via the form action prop, useFormStatus, and useActionState, which often removes the need for per-field controlled state.

What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled React components?
Controlled components
A controlled input passes both value (or checked) and onChange to the element. React state holds the truth; every keystroke flows through a setter.

```js
import { useState } from "react";

function ControlledForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert("A name was submitted: " + name);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          type="text"
          value={name}
          onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

Uncontrolled components
An uncontrolled input keeps its value in the DOM. Seed the initial value with defaultValue (or defaultChecked for checkboxes/radios), and read the current value through a ref when you need it.

```js
import { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert("A name was submitted: " + inputRef.current.value);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input type="text" defaultValue="" ref={inputRef} />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

defaultValue is only consulted on the initial render — changing it later does not update the DOM. Pairing value with no onChange (or vice versa) makes the input read-only or warns in development; pick one mode per field.

<input type="file"> is always uncontrolled
File inputs cannot be controlled — their value is read-only for security reasons (a page must not be able to set the user's chosen file). Always read files via a ref or from the change/submit event, even in an otherwise controlled form.

````js
function FileForm() {
  const fileRef = useRef(null);

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const file = fileRef.current.files[0];
    // upload file...
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="file" ref={fileRef} />
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
  );
}```
