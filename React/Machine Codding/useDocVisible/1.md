Here's a custom hook that detects whether the application is currently visible to the user.

For example, if the user minimizes the app or switches to another tab, it returns `false`, indicating the user is not currently viewing the app. When the user returns to the tab, it returns `true`.

This can be very useful in many scenarios. Some use cases include:

1. Sending analytics data to the backend when the user is away.

2. Pausing an image carousel to prevent it from advancing to the next slide unless the user is viewing the page.

3. Stopping a dashboard from polling the server for updates when the page is not visible, thereby conserving resources.

Note: To avoid exception on server side/ meta framework use something like: if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof document !== 'undefined')
