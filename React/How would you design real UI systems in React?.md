***  How would you design real UI systems in React?.md ***

1. 𝐓𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦
A toast system works like a global messenger.
I manage notifications using "global state (Context/Redux)" and maintain a "queue". Only a few toasts appear at once while others wait. Auto-dismiss removes them, and layout logic prevents overlapping.

2. 𝐍𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝 (𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭)
Comments follow a "tree structure".
Each comment renders itself and "recursively renders its replies".
To keep performance smooth: memoization, pagination for deep threads, and collapsing long chains are essential.

3. 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐒𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐫 𝐍𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
Desktop → Fixed sidebar
Mobile → Collapsible drawer
State controls open/close behavior. Submenus expand independently. Routes are driven from a "config file", making the sidebar dynamic and scalable.

4. 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐀𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
Active tab is stored in state, and content renders dynamically.
For smooth transitions, I prefer "CSS transitions or Framer Motion" so the UI feels polished, not abrupt.

5. 𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 & 𝐒𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞
I modularize into "Table, Header, Filters, Pagination".
For large datasets, I use "server-side pagination" or "virtual scrolling" to avoid freezing the browser.

6. 𝐋𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐁𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬
UI updates instantly when clicked. API runs in the background.
If the request fails, I "rollback the state".
Users experience speed, while data remains reliable.

7. 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞
I’d choose "WebSockets over polling" for real-time updates.
Messages live in state, and typing indicators are handled as temporary events.

8. 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐦 (𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞/𝐃𝐞𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐞)
Search inputs → "Debounce"
Rapid clicks → "Throttle"
This protects the backend and improves performance. Can be done with lodash or a custom hook.

9. 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐩𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐨𝐧
Each section has its own open state.
You can allow "single-open (FAQ style)" or "multi-open (settings style)". Smooth height transitions improve the experience.

10. 𝐃𝐚𝐫𝐤/𝐋𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠
I prefer "CSS variables + Context API".
Theme is stored globally, and a class on the root updates colors instantly, clean, scalable, and maintainable.
