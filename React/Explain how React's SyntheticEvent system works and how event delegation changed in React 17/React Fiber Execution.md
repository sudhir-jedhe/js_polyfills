Based on the provided code image, here is the exact code snippet along with a complete breakdown of its execution order and output.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useLayoutEffect } from "react";

class Parent extends React.Component {
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() {
    console.log("Parent snapshot");
    return null;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log("Parent did update");
  }

  render() {
    console.log("Parent render");
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

function Child() {
  console.log("Child render");

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log("Child layout effect");
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Child passive effect");
  });

  return <p>Child</p>;
}

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Trigger update after initial mount
    setCount(1);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Parent>
      <Child />
      <div>count: {count}</div>
    </Parent>
  );
}

# Execution Order & Console Output

When this component tree mounts, two execution cycles occur sequentially: the **Initial Mount Phase** followed by the **Update Phase** (triggered by `setCount(1)`).

### 1. Initial Mount Phase Output

During the initial render, React traverses top-down for component evaluation and bottom-up during the layout/effect execution phase. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` and `componentDidUpdate` are skipped on initial mount.

```text
Parent render
Child render
Child layout effect
Child passive effect

```

---

### 2. Update Phase Output (Triggered by `setCount(1)`)

When `App`'s `useEffect` calls `setCount(1)`:

1. **Render Phase (Top-Down):** `App` re-renders, causing `Parent` and `Child` to re-render sequentially.
2. **Before Mutation Phase:** `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` fires on `Parent` before DOM mutations.
3. **Mutation Phase:** React updates the real DOM nodes (`count` changes from 0 to 1).
4. **Layout Phase (Bottom-Up Synchronous):** `Child`'s `useLayoutEffect` runs first, followed by `Parent`'s `componentDidUpdate`.
5. **Passive Effects Phase (Async Post-Paint):** `Child`'s `useEffect` runs asynchronously after the browser paints the updated DOM.

```text
Parent render
Child render
Parent snapshot
Child layout effect
Parent did update
Child passive effect

```

---

### Combined Total Console Output

```text
// --- Initial Mount Phase ---
Parent render
Child render
Child layout effect
Child passive effect

// --- Re-render / Update Phase ---
Parent render
Child render
Parent snapshot
Child layout effect
Parent did update
Child passive effect

```

## Key Takeaways from React Fiber Execution

* **Render Order (Top-Down):** Parent components evaluate before child components (`Parent render` $\rightarrow$ `Child render`).
* **Effect Execution Order (Bottom-Up):** Synchronous layout effects and lifecycle methods in child nodes resolve before parent notifications.
* **`useLayoutEffect` vs `useEffect`:** `useLayoutEffect` fires synchronously in the Commit Layout phase before browser paint to prevent visual flicker. `useEffect` is scheduled asynchronously in the Passive Effects phase after paint.
* **`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` Scope:** Only executes during update cycles (re-renders), running in the "Before Mutation" sub-phase before React applies changes to the live DOM.
