*** copy React's Layout Phase: Ref Attachments & useLayoutEffect.md ***

Here is a clean, structured technical reference guide breaking down the **Layout Phase**, ref binding guarantees, and why `useLayoutEffect` operates as a synchronous pre-paint circuit breaker.

# React's Layout Phase: Ref Attachments & `useLayoutEffect`

The **Layout Phase** is the third sub-phase of React's **Commit Phase**. It represents a critical execution window: the moment **after live DOM nodes have been mutated in memory**, but **before the browser paints pixels to the physical display**.

---

## 1. The Pre-Paint Pipeline

Because JavaScript execution and browser layout/paint passes share a single main thread, code executing in the Layout Phase acts as a **synchronous block** against screen rendering.

```text
 ┌─────────────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────────┐
 │   1. MUTATION PHASE     │ ───► │    2. LAYOUT PHASE      │ ───► │    3. BROWSER PAINT     │
 │ Mutates live HTML DOM   │      │ Ref binding &           │      │ Calculates styles &     │
 │ (Deletions/Insertions)  │      │ useLayoutEffect (Sync)  │      │ paints pixels on screen │
 └─────────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────────┘      └─────────────────────────┘

```

## 2. Two Synchronous Steps in Strict Order

During the Layout Phase, React performs two operations sequentially across the Fiber tree:

### Step 1: Ref Attachment (`ref.current`)

During the preceding Mutation Phase, unmounted or updated refs were detached (`ref.current = null`). In the Layout Phase, React attaches live DOM instances to their ref objects:

* **Host Elements (`<div ref={myRef}>`):** Sets `myRef.current = HTMLDivElement`.
* **Callback Refs (`ref={(node) => ...}`):** Invokes the callback function with the live DOM node instance (and handles cleanup functions in React 19).

> **Why Render-Phase Ref Access Is Anti-Pattern:** Reading `ref.current` during rendering is unreliable because the DOM mutation has not yet occurred. The Layout Phase is the first point in a component's lifecycle where `ref.current` is guaranteed to point to a fully-formed, updated DOM node.

### Step 2: `useLayoutEffect` Callbacks

Once all refs across the tree are bound, React executes `useLayoutEffect` hooks in two passes:

1. **Previous Cleanups First:** Runs cleanup functions from the previous render pass for components whose dependencies changed.
2. **New Setups Second:** Executes new `useLayoutEffect` setup callbacks synchronously.

## 3. Traversal Order: Depth-First Post-Order (Child-First)

React traverses the Fiber tree during the Layout Phase in **depth-first post-order**—meaning children process before their parents.

```text
                        [ 3. Parent Layout Effect ]
                                    ▲
                                    │
                       ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                       │                         │
            [ 1. Child A Layout Effect ]  [ 2. Child B Layout Effect ]

```

### Why Child-First Matters

Child components bind their refs and execute layout measurements before their parent components. This guarantees that when a parent component measures its DOM bounds (e.g., measuring container dimensions that depend on child sizes), all descendant DOM elements are already settled and readable in memory.

---

## 4. Flicker Prevention vs. Main Thread Blocking

Because `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously before paint, any state updates triggered inside it are batched into the **same rendering pass**:

```text
 Using useLayoutEffect (Flicker-Free):
 [ DOM Update ] ──► [ useLayoutEffect measures & setTop() ] ──► [ Re-render in memory ] ──► [ SINGLE BROWSER PAINT ]

 Using useEffect (Visual Flicker):
 [ DOM Update ] ──► [ BROWSER PAINTS UNPOSITIONED FRAME ] ──► [ useEffect setTop() ] ──► [ BROWSER PAINTS POSITIONED FRAME ]

```

### When to Use `useLayoutEffect`

* Measuring DOM node geometry (`getBoundingClientRect()`, `offsetWidth`, `scrollHeight`).
* Imperatively adjusting scroll offsets or tooltip positions to prevent visual layout shifts.
* Auto-focusing inputs or syncing scroll positions before user visibility.

### When NOT to Use `useLayoutEffect`

* Data fetching / API calls.
* Setting up subscriptions or WebSockets.
* Analytics logging or state synchronization.
* *Anything that can run post-paint without causing visual glitches.*
