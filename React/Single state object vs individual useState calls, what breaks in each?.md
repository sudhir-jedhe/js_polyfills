***  Single state object vs individual useState calls, what breaks in each?.md ***

Choosing between a single state object (`useState({ ... })`) and multiple individual state calls (`useState(...)`) in React depends on state co-location and update frequency. Both approaches have specific failure modes and edge cases that can break your application.

Here is a breakdown of what breaks in each approach, why it happens, and how to prevent it.

---

### 1. What Breaks in a Single State Object (`useState({ ... })`)

#### A. Accidental State Overwrite (Missing Spread Operator)

Unlike class components' `this.setState` or Redux reducers, React's `useState` updater function **does not merge state automatically**—it completely overwrites the existing state object.

```tsx
// ❌ BROKEN: Overwrites the entire object!
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Sudhir', role: 'Developer', city: 'Pune' });

const updateRole = () => {
  // 'name' and 'city' are deleted from state!
  setUser({ role: 'Lead Developer' }); 
};

// ✅ FIXED: Must manually spread existing state
const updateRoleFixed = () => {
  setUser((prev) => ({ ...prev, role: 'Lead Developer' }));
};

```

#### B. Stale Closure Bugs During Concurrent Updates

If you update nested properties relying on a direct reference to the outer state variable rather than a functional update (`prev => ...`), rapid user interactions will trigger race conditions where later updates overwrite earlier ones.

```tsx
// ❌ BROKEN: Rapid clicks use stale 'form' references
const [form, setForm] = useState({ step: 1, count: 0 });

const handleFastClick = () => {
  setForm({ ...form, count: form.count + 1 });
  setForm({ ...form, step: form.step + 1 }); // Overwrites the 'count' increment!
};

// ✅ FIXED: Always use functional updaters for state objects
const handleFastClickFixed = () => {
  setForm((prev) => ({ ...prev, count: prev.count + 1 }));
  setForm((prev) => ({ ...prev, step: prev.step + 1 }));
};

```

#### C. Unnecessary Re-renders via Memory Reference Shifts

When you update *any* field in a single state object, you create a brand-new object reference. If child components or custom hooks consume parts of this object, they will re-render even if their specific property didn't change (unless wrapped in atomic selectors or custom memoization).

### 2. What Breaks in Individual `useState` Calls

#### A. Out-of-Sync State Transitions (Broken Invariants)

When two or more state variables must always change together to keep the UI in a valid state, splitting them into separate `useState` calls can introduce race conditions, asynchronous tearing, or invalid intermediate states.

```tsx
// ❌ BROKEN: States can get out of sync during async operations
const [data, setData] = useState<Data | null>(null);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

const fetchData = async () => {
  setIsLoading(true);
  try {
    const res = await apiCall();
    // If component unmounts or network lags, isLoading and data can desynchronize!
    setData(res);
    setError(null);
  } catch (err) {
    setError('Failed');
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};

```

#### B. Boilerplate Bloat in Forms

Using individual `useState` hooks for forms with dozens of fields results in excessive handler functions and bloated component code.

```tsx
// ❌ HARD TO MAINTAIN: Verbose for large forms
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');
const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');
const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
const [phone, setPhone] = useState('');
// Requires 4+ individual state handlers...

```

### Summary Comparison Matrix

| Scenario                        | Single State Object                                                              | Individual `useState` Calls                                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Updating Fields**             | Must explicitly spread (`...prev`). Easy to accidentally wipe sibling fields.    | Simple and isolated (`setAge(35)`). No risk of wiping other variables. |
| **Co-dependent State**          | **Optimal.** Guarantees atomic updates for state variables that change together. | Risk of states desynchronizing during async transitions.               |
| **Primitive Values**            | Adds object allocation overhead.                                                 | **Optimal** for independent primitives (`isOpen`, `activeTab`).        |
| **Refactoring to `useReducer**` | Easy transition since state is already grouped in an object.                     | Requires rewriting state structures across the component.              |

### Architectural Decision Framework

1. **Use Individual `useState` Calls When:**

* The variables represent independent primitives (`const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)`).
* The variables update at completely different frequencies or in response to unrelated events.

1. **Use a Single State Object When:**

* You are managing form field inputs (`const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ ... })`).
* Multiple variables depend on each other and must update atomically.

1. **Switch to `useReducer` When:**

* The single state object becomes complex, contains nested objects/arrays, or involves multi-step status transitions (e.g., `'IDLE' | 'LOADING' | 'SUCCESS' | 'ERROR'`).
