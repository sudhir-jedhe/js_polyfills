### Why Can't We Pass an Async Function Directly to `useEffect`?

In React, the `useEffect` hook expects the function you provide to return either:

1. **Nothing** (i.e., `undefined`), which means there is no cleanup.
2. **A cleanup function**, which is typically a function that React will run when the component unmounts or when dependencies change.

However, **an async function always returns a `Promise`**, not a cleanup function. This creates a mismatch between what `useEffect` expects and what an async function returns.

### React's `useEffect` Expectation

`useEffect` is designed to handle **synchronous effects** and optionally allows a **cleanup function** to be returned. Here’s the typical structure of `useEffect`:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Side-effect code goes here
  
  // Optionally return a cleanup function
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

The function passed to `useEffect` should return either:

- `undefined` (default behavior) — meaning there’s no cleanup.
- A **cleanup function** that React will call when the component unmounts or when the effect dependencies change.

### Problem with Async Functions in `useEffect`

An **async function** always returns a `Promise`. When React expects a synchronous return value (either `undefined` or a cleanup function), and you return a `Promise` instead, this causes a conflict.

Here’s what happens:

```js
useEffect(async () => {
  // This is an async function
  await fetchData();
}, []);  // Dependency array
```

In this case, the async function inside `useEffect` will return a `Promise` instead of a cleanup function, which is not what React expects.

### Example: Incorrect Use

```js
useEffect(async () => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log(data);
}, []);
```

#### What's wrong with this?

- **React expects the return value** to be either `undefined` or a cleanup function, but the async function returns a `Promise`.
- The `Promise` is not used in the expected way, which can lead to bugs and confusing behavior.

### Solution: Wrapping Async Logic Inside the `useEffect` Hook

To fix this, you should **define the async function inside the effect** and then call it, instead of making the `useEffect` itself async. This way, the `useEffect` still behaves as expected, returning `undefined` or a cleanup function, while handling asynchronous operations inside.

### Correct Approach

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    console.log(data);
  };

  fetchData();  // Call the async function

  // Optionally, return a cleanup function (if needed)
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code if needed
  };
}, []);  // Empty dependency array, so this runs once when the component mounts
```

### Explanation:

- **Inner Async Function:** The async logic is now inside an inner function (`fetchData`) that is invoked inside the effect. This way, the `useEffect` itself is not `async` but can still handle async operations.
- **Returning Cleanup (Optional):** You can still return a cleanup function from the `useEffect` if needed (e.g., canceling an ongoing fetch operation when the component unmounts).

### Benefits of This Approach:

- **Compliance with React's expectations:** The `useEffect` returns either `undefined` (default) or a cleanup function, as React expects.
- **Asynchronous logic handling:** We can still handle async code, such as fetching data or performing side effects, without breaking React's rules.

### Conclusion:

- **Why we can't pass async directly to `useEffect`:** Because `useEffect` expects either no return or a cleanup function, but an async function returns a `Promise`, which isn't valid in this context.
- **Solution:** Wrap the async logic inside a function within the effect and invoke it there.
