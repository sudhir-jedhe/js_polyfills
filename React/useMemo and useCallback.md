In React, `useMemo` and `useCallback` are both hooks that optimize performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations or re-creations of values and functions. While they serve similar purposes, they are used in different situations.

Here’s a detailed explanation of both:

### **1. `useMemo`**

`useMemo` is a hook that memoizes a computed value. It caches the result of a function call and returns the cached result unless one of the dependencies changes. It’s primarily used to optimize **expensive computations** by recalculating the result only when necessary.

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

- **First argument**: A function that returns the value to be memoized (e.g., the result of a calculation or a transformation).
- **Second argument**: An array of dependencies that determines when the memoized value should be recomputed. If any of these dependencies change, the memoized value is recalculated.

#### **Use case:**
- When you have an expensive function or calculation, and you want to avoid recomputing it unless its dependencies change.
  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState(0);

  // Expensive calculation
  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Computing expensive value...');
    return input * 1000;
  }, [input]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Expensive Value: {expensiveValue}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setInput(input + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this example, `expensiveValue` will only be recomputed when the `input` state changes. If the `input` state doesn't change, the cached value is used, and the expensive calculation is skipped.

### **2. `useCallback`**

`useCallback` is similar to `useMemo`, but instead of memoizing a value, it memoizes a **function**. It returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of its dependencies has changed. 

#### **Syntax:**
```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // function logic
}, [dependencies]);
```

- **First argument**: A function that you want to memoize.
- **Second argument**: An array of dependencies. The memoized function is recreated only if one of the dependencies changes.

#### **Use case:**
- When you pass a function down to a child component as a prop, and you want to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the child component by ensuring the function reference remains the same unless its dependencies change.
  
#### **Example:**
```javascript
import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Memoizing the function to prevent unnecessary re-renders in ChildComponent
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); // Only recreates the function when `count` changes

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ onClick }) {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Increment</button>;
}
```

In this example, `handleClick` is memoized using `useCallback`. This ensures that the function reference passed to `ChildComponent` doesn't change on every render, which prevents unnecessary re-renders of `ChildComponent` unless `count` changes.

### **Key Differences Between `useMemo` and `useCallback`**

| Feature                      | **`useMemo`**                            | **`useCallback`**                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                   | Memoizes a **value** (the result of a computation) | Memoizes a **function** (a callback function) |
| **What it optimizes**         | Expensive calculations or derived values | Function reference stability (to prevent unnecessary re-renders) |
| **Return value**              | Memoized **value**                      | Memoized **function**                     |
| **When to use**                | When you want to prevent re-computation of a value | When passing a function to child components to prevent re-creations |
| **Common use case**           | Expensive calculations that depend on some state or props | Event handlers or callback functions passed to child components |

### **When to Use `useMemo` vs. `useCallback`**

- **Use `useMemo`** when you have an expensive calculation that you want to avoid recalculating unless the dependencies change. This is useful for cases like:
  - Expensive mathematical calculations.
  - Transforming large arrays or objects.
  - Filtering or sorting large data sets.
  
- **Use `useCallback`** when you are passing a function to child components and you want to prevent unnecessary re-renders. This ensures the function reference stays the same unless its dependencies change. It's especially helpful when passing functions as props to child components that are optimized with `React.memo` or `PureComponent`.

### **Example of Both in Action**

Here’s a scenario where both `useMemo` and `useCallback` can be used together:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent() {
  const [input, setInput] = useState(0);

  // Expensive calculation memoized
  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Computing expensive value...');
    return input * 1000;
  }, [input]);

  // Memoized callback function
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setInput(prevInput => prevInput + 1);
  }, []); // No dependencies, function won't change unless explicitly required

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Expensive Value: {expensiveValue}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increase Input</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:
- `useMemo` memoizes the result of the expensive calculation (`expensiveValue`), ensuring it’s recalculated only when `input` changes.
- `useCallback` memoizes the `handleClick` function, ensuring it’s not re-created on every render of the `ExpensiveComponent`.

### **Conclusion**

- **`useMemo`**: Used to **memoize values** and optimize expensive calculations.
- **`useCallback`**: Used to **memoize functions** and prevent unnecessary re-renders of components that rely on functions as props.

While both hooks are related to performance optimization, they target different aspects of your app—`useMemo` is for values, and `useCallback` is for functions. They are often used together in scenarios where both computation and function stability are important.
