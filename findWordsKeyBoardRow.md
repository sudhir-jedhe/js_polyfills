Your solution is quite close, but there is a small issue with how you're checking if a character is present in the row sets. Specifically, you are checking if the character exists in a `Set` by using the `in` operator, which works for arrays or objects, but not for `Set` objects in JavaScript. 

To fix this, we should use the `has` method, which is the correct way to check if a value is in a `Set`. Here's the updated and corrected version of your `findWords` function:

### Corrected Code:

```javascript
export function findWords(words) {
  const row1 = new Set("qwertyuiop"); // First row of letters
  const row2 = new Set("asdfghjkl"); // Second row of letters
  const row3 = new Set("zxcvbnm");   // Third row of letters

  return words.filter((word) => {
    const lowercaseWord = word.toLowerCase(); // Convert word to lowercase
    // Determine the row of the first character
    const firstCharRow =
      row1.has(lowercaseWord[0]) ? row1 : row2.has(lowercaseWord[0]) ? row2 : row3;

    // Check if all subsequent characters are in the same row
    for (let i = 1; i < lowercaseWord.length; i++) {
      if (!firstCharRow.has(lowercaseWord[i])) {
        return false; // Word uses letters from multiple rows
      }
    }
    return true; // Word uses letters from only one row
  });
}

import { findWords } from "./findWords.js";

const words = ["Hello", "Alaska", "Dad", "Peace"];
console.log(findWords(words)); // Output: ["Alaska", "Dad"]
```

### Explanation:
1. **Creating Row Sets**: You have three sets: `row1`, `row2`, and `row3` which represent the three rows on a standard QWERTY keyboard. The characters in each set correspond to letters in those rows.

2. **Processing Each Word**: For each word in the `words` array:
   - Convert the word to lowercase to handle case-insensitivity.
   - Determine which row the first character belongs to.
   - Then, check if all subsequent characters belong to the same row by checking each character using the `has()` method for sets.

3. **Filter Words**: Words that use only characters from a single row are kept in the result, and those that span multiple rows are discarded.

### Example:

#### Input:
```javascript
const words = ["Hello", "Alaska", "Dad", "Peace"];
console.log(findWords(words)); // Output: ["Alaska", "Dad"]
```

#### Explanation:
- `"Hello"` uses characters from both the first and second rows (`h` and `e` from row 1, and `l` and `o` from row 2), so it's excluded.
- `"Alaska"` can be typed entirely with letters from the second row (`a, s, k`).
- `"Dad"` uses only letters from the second row (`d, a`).
- `"Peace"` uses characters from both the first and second rows, so it’s excluded.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single-letter Words**: Single letter words will always pass because they can be typed using one row. For example:
   ```javascript
   findWords(["A", "B", "C", "Q", "Z"]); // Output: ["A", "B", "C", "Q", "Z"]
   ```

2. **All Letters from One Row**: If all letters in the word belong to one row, it should return the word. For example:
   ```javascript
   findWords(["ASD", "QWERTY", "ZXCVBNM"]); // Output: ["ASD", "QWERTY", "ZXCVBNM"]
   ```

3. **Empty Array**: If the input is an empty array, the result should be an empty array:
   ```javascript
   findWords([]); // Output: []
   ```

### Time Complexity:
- **Filtering words**: We loop through each word in the `words` array. The time complexity of filtering is O(n), where `n` is the number of words.
- **Checking characters**: For each word, we loop through its characters. If the word has `m` characters, the time complexity is O(m) for each word.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of the words.

### Conclusion:
This updated solution is now correct and efficient, and it handles all edge cases such as case insensitivity and single-letter words.
