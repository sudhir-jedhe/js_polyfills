Your solution to check for valid anagrams is quite clear, and you're exploring two approaches. Let's walk through both of them, their time and space complexities, and possible optimizations.

### 1. **Approach 1: Sorting and Comparing**

```javascript
const isAnagram1 = function (s, t) {
  s = s.split("").sort().join("");  // Sort string s
  t = t.split("").sort().join("");  // Sort string t

  return s === t;
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting:** Both strings are split into individual characters, sorted alphabetically, and then joined back together. If the two strings are anagrams, the sorted versions will be identical.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Sorting each string takes **O(n log n)** where `n` is the length of the string.
  - The comparison of the two sorted strings is **O(n)**.
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is **O(n)** because we store the sorted versions of the strings.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(isAnagram1("anagram", "nagaram"));  // Output: true
console.log(isAnagram1("rat", "car"));          // Output: false
```

### 2. **Approach 2: Frequency Count using Hashmaps**

```javascript
const isAnagram = function (s, t) {
  if (s.length !== t.length) return false;  // If lengths don't match, not an anagram

  let obj1 = {};  // Frequency map for string s
  let obj2 = {};  // Frequency map for string t

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    obj1[s[i]] = (obj1[s[i]] || 0) + 1;  // Count characters in s
    obj2[t[i]] = (obj2[t[i]] || 0) + 1;  // Count characters in t
  }

  for (const key in obj1) {
    if (obj1[key] !== obj2[key]) return false;  // Check if frequencies match
  }

  return true;
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Frequency Map:** This approach counts the frequency of each character in both strings using two hash maps (`obj1` for `s` and `obj2` for `t`).
- **Length Check:** First, the lengths of the two strings are compared. If they're not equal, they can't be anagrams, and the function returns `false` immediately.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Counting characters in both strings takes **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.
  - Comparing the frequency maps takes **O(k)**, where `k` is the number of unique characters. Since the number of unique characters is at most 26 (for English lowercase letters), this step is effectively **O(1)**.
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is **O(n)**, due to the two frequency maps that store counts for each character in the string.

#### Example:

```javascript
console.log(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram"));  // Output: true
console.log(isAnagram("rat", "car"));          // Output: false
```

### Time and Space Complexity Comparison

| Approach                        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Sorting and Comparing**        | O(n log n)      | O(n)             |
| **Frequency Count (Hashmaps)**   | O(n)            | O(n)             |

- **Time Complexity:** The second approach (frequency count) is more efficient with **O(n)** compared to the first approach's **O(n log n)**.
- **Space Complexity:** Both approaches use **O(n)** space, but the frequency count method avoids the need for sorting, making it the more optimal approach in terms of time complexity.

---

### Conclusion:
- **For performance:** The **frequency count (hashmap)** approach is more efficient because it runs in **O(n)** time, compared to the sorting approach that runs in **O(n log n)** time.
- **For simplicity:** If readability and simplicity are a priority (and the input size is small), the sorting approach might be slightly easier to understand. However, it's generally less efficient for larger inputs.

### Final Thoughts:
You can simplify and optimize the solution based on the input constraints. For very large strings, the frequency count method will likely be more practical due to its linear time complexity.
