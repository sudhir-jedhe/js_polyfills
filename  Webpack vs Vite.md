***   Webpack vs Vite.md ***

**1️⃣5️⃣ Can Vite replace Webpack completely?** *(Completed)*

Not always. While Vite works well for most modern applications, some older projects or highly customized enterprise setups still require Webpack. Specifically:

* **Legacy Browser Support:** Webpack has deeper tooling for legacy polyfills and environments that cannot parse native ES Modules.
* **Complex Custom Plugins & Loaders:** Teams with years of bespoke Webpack plugins often find migration costs too high.
* **Module Federation:** While Vite has third-party plugins for Module Federation, Webpack 5's native Module Federation remains the enterprise standard for complex micro-frontend architectures.

### Quick Summary: Webpack vs. Vite

| Feature                 | Webpack                                    | Vite                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dev Server Approach** | Bundles entire app before serving          | Native ESM on-demand (no dev bundling)                    |
| **Dev Transpiler**      | Babel / `ts-loader` / SWC                  | **esbuild** (written in Go, $10\text{–}100\times$ faster) |
| **Dev Startup Speed**   | $O(n)$ with app size (slower as app grows) | $O(1)$ constant time (instant startup)                    |
| **HMR Performance**     | Rebuilds affected dependency chunks        | Instant (re-requests only the changed module)             |
| **Production Bundler**  | Webpack (in-house)                         | **Rollup** (or **Rolldown** in newer ecosystems)          |
| **Configuration**       | Verbose, complex setup                     | Zero-config / minimal defaults out of the box             |
| **Best Suited For**     | Large legacy apps, complex micro-frontends | Modern SPAs (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid)                   |

### Next Evolution to Watch: Turbopack & Rolldown

* **Turbopack:** Vercel's Rust-based successor to Webpack, built directly into Next.js.
* **Rolldown:** A Rust-based port of Rollup designed to unify Vite's dev server and production builds into a single, high-performance engine.
