All three implementations demonstrate how to calculate the quotient and remainder of the division of two numbers, \( a \) and \( b \), using different methods to find the quotient. Here's a breakdown:

---

### **1. Using `Math.floor`**
```javascript
let a = 39;
let b = 5;
function Geeks() {
  console.log("quotient = " + Math.floor(a / b));
  console.log("remainder = " + (a % b));
}
Geeks();
```
**Explanation**:
- **`Math.floor(a / b)`** computes the largest integer less than or equal to \( a / b \). 
- The remainder is calculated directly using the modulo operator \( a \% b \).

**Output**:
```
quotient = 7
remainder = 4
```

---

### **2. Using Bitwise `~~` (Double NOT Operator)**
```javascript
let a = 39;
let b = 5;
function Geeks() {
  let num = ~~(a / b);
  console.log("quotient = " + num);
  console.log("remainder = " + (a % b));
}
Geeks();
```
**Explanation**:
- **`~~(a / b)`** truncates the fractional part of \( a / b \) by using the bitwise double NOT operator. It is equivalent to \( Math.trunc \) for positive numbers.
- The remainder is calculated in the same way as before.

**Output**:
```
quotient = 7
remainder = 4
```

---

### **3. Using Bitwise Right Shift `>>`**
```javascript
let a = 39;
let b = 5;
function Geeks() {
  let num = (a / b) >> 0;
  console.log("quotient = " + num);
  console.log("remainder = " + (a % b));
}
Geeks();
```
**Explanation**:
- **`(a / b) >> 0`** shifts the bits of the result of \( a / b \) to the right, effectively truncating the fractional part. It is equivalent to \( Math.trunc \) for positive numbers.
- The remainder is calculated using \( a \% b \).

**Output**:
```
quotient = 7
remainder = 4
```

### **Comparison**

| Method                | Description                                 | Use Case                                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **`Math.floor`**      | Rounds down to the nearest integer.         | Works with both positive and negative values. |
| **Bitwise `~~`**      | Truncates decimals for positive numbers.    | Fast, compact for positive numbers.     |
| **Bitwise `>>`**      | Right shift to truncate decimals.           | Fast, but works only for positive numbers. |

### **Recommendation**
- Use **`Math.floor`** if the inputs may include negative values or for more clarity.
- Use **`~~`** or **`>>`** for compact, fast calculations when inputs are guaranteed to be non-negative.
