### Explanation of the Code:

You provided two different functions for rounding a number, and both implement the rounding in different ways. Let's walk through them.

### 1. **First Function Using `Math.ceil()`**

```javascript
function round(x) {
  return Math.ceil(x / 5) * 5;
}

var n = 34;
console.log(round(n)); // Output: 35
```

- **How it works**: 
  - `x / 5`: Divides the input number by 5.
  - `Math.ceil(x / 5)`: Rounds the result of the division up to the nearest whole number (ceiling).
  - `Math.ceil(x / 5) * 5`: Multiplies the rounded result by 5, which gives the next multiple of 5.
  
- **Example**:
  - For `n = 34`:
    - `34 / 5 = 6.8`
    - `Math.ceil(6.8) = 7`
    - `7 * 5 = 35`
  
- **Output**: `35`
  
This method always rounds the number **up** to the nearest multiple of 5.

### 2. **Second Function Using `Math.floor()`**

```javascript
function round(x) {
  if (x % 5 == 0) {
    return Math.floor(x / 5) * 5;
  } else {
    return Math.floor(x / 5) * 5 + 5;
  }
}

var n = 34;
console.log(round(n)); // Output: 35
```

- **How it works**:
  - If the number is already a multiple of 5 (`x % 5 == 0`), it uses `Math.floor(x / 5) * 5` to keep it as is (though in practice, this part of the logic is redundant because if `x` is already a multiple of 5, the result will naturally be the same).
  - If the number is **not** a multiple of 5, it divides the number by 5, uses `Math.floor()` to round the quotient **down** to the nearest whole number, and then adds 5 to get the next multiple of 5.
  
- **Example**:
  - For `n = 34`:
    - `34 % 5 == 4` (not a multiple of 5)
    - `Math.floor(34 / 5) = Math.floor(6.8) = 6`
    - `6 * 5 + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35`
  
- **Output**: `35`

This method rounds the number **up** to the next multiple of 5 if it is not already a multiple of 5.

### Comparison of Both Functions:

- The **first function** always rounds up the number to the nearest multiple of 5, regardless of whether the number is already a multiple of 5.
- The **second function** checks whether the number is a multiple of 5:
  - If it is, it just returns the same number (though this logic is redundant since it could use `x` directly).
  - If it is not, it rounds up to the next multiple of 5.

### Summary:
- **Both methods round numbers to the nearest multiple of 5**. However, the second function is a bit more explicit in checking whether the number is already a multiple of 5 before performing the rounding.
