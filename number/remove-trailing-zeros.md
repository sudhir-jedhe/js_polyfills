To remove trailing zeros from a number after converting it to a fixed-point string, there are several approaches you can consider. Below are the three main methods described in your message:

### 1. **Using Regular Expressions**

You can use a regular expression to remove trailing zeros after the decimal point. This works well if you want to handle a fixed number of decimal places, but itâ€™s a bit tricky when you have to handle all edge cases.

#### Code:

```javascript
const toFixedWithoutZeros = (num, precision) =>
  num.toFixed(precision).replace(/\.0+$/, '');

console.log(toFixedWithoutZeros(1.001, 2)); // '1'
console.log(toFixedWithoutZeros(1.500, 2)); // '1.5'
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - `num.toFixed(precision)` converts the number to a string with the specified precision.
  - The regular expression `\.0+$` looks for a decimal point followed by one or more zeros and removes them.
  
However, this method only removes trailing zeros when there are no non-zero digits after the decimal point. It doesn't work well in cases where the number is more complex.

### 2. **Multiplying by 1**

Another way to remove trailing zeros is to multiply the number by `1`. This method works because JavaScript will automatically trim any unnecessary zeros when converting the number back to a string.

#### Code:

```javascript
const toFixedWithoutZeros = (num, precision) =>
  `${1 * num.toFixed(precision)}`;

console.log(toFixedWithoutZeros(1.001, 2)); // '1'
console.log(toFixedWithoutZeros(1.500, 2)); // '1.5'
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `num.toFixed(precision)` gives you a fixed-point string.
  - `1 * num.toFixed(precision)` forces JavaScript to convert it back to a number, effectively removing unnecessary zeros.
  - The result is then converted back to a string using template literals.

This approach works well because JavaScript automatically converts the result back to a number without the unnecessary trailing zeros.

### 3. **Using `Number.parseFloat()`**

A cleaner and more readable approach is to use `Number.parseFloat()`, which automatically removes trailing zeros when converting the number back to a float.

#### Code:

```javascript
const toFixedWithoutZeros = (num, precision) =>
  `${Number.parseFloat(num.toFixed(precision))}`;

console.log(toFixedWithoutZeros(1.001, 2)); // '1'
console.log(toFixedWithoutZeros(1.500, 2)); // '1.5'
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `num.toFixed(precision)` gives you a fixed-point string.
  - `Number.parseFloat(num.toFixed(precision))` converts the string back to a floating-point number, automatically trimming the trailing zeros.
  - Finally, we use template literals to convert it back to a string.

This approach is very readable and effective for most cases.

### Comparison of Methods:

| **Method**              | **Pros**                                          | **Cons**                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Regular Expression**   | Allows you to handle custom formatting rules.     | Harder to read, doesn't always work for all cases. |
| **Multiply by 1**        | Simple and effective for removing trailing zeros. | Requires conversion back to string.        |
| **`Number.parseFloat()`** | Clean and readable, accounts for various cases.   | Similar to multiplying by 1, but more readable. |

### Best Approach

The **`Number.parseFloat()`** method is the most readable and reliable approach to remove trailing zeros in JavaScript. It is easy to understand and works well for most use cases, ensuring that you handle both small and large numbers correctly.
