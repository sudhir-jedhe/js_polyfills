Microfrontends are the future of web development.

When implemented correctly,
They can transform your app's architecture.

So build better apps today.
Follow these steps to develop microfrontends.

1. Identify Microfrontend Boundaries: Break down your app into logical, independent components.
2. Select a Framework or Library: Use Single-SPA or Module Federation for seamless integration.
3. Set Up Independent Repositories: Maintain separate versioning and deployments for each microfrontend.
4. Build Communication and State Management: Use custom events or shared state tools like Redux.
5. Routing and Navigation: Ensure smooth transitions with built-in or custom routing solutions.
6. Deployment Strategy: Deploy each microfrontend independently using CI/CD pipelines.
7. Implement a Shell Application: Load different microfrontends as users interact with the app.
8. Testing: Use end-to-end tools like Cypress or Playwright for smooth integration.

Example Tools and Libraries for Building Microfrontends:

- Single-SPA: Orchestrates different microfrontends on the same page.
- Webpack Module Federation: Facilitates module sharing.
- qiankun: Popular in the Vue ecosystem.
- Federated Modules (in Next.js): Supports microfrontends in Next.js apps.
